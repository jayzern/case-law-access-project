FORMATION AND PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS TO SELL STOCK. § 331: Shares of stock ore transferable.-That shares of stock in a corporation are transferable the same as other personal property is a principle of law coeval with the existence of stock itself. The few decisions holding that shares of stock were real estate were exceptional rulings, and are no longer considered good law.&#x0027; The right to transfer stock is of vital importance, since the two chief causes of the phenomenal growth of corporations in recent times are the limited liability of the members and the readiness of buy- ing or selling an interest in the corporation by a transfer of the stock a person has therein. The common law regards shares of

		<ocrText>
			stock as personal property, capable of alienation or succession in any of the modes by which personal property may be transferred.1
			§ 332. Restrictions on &#x0027;rillt to sell stock and contracts against sclling/.- By-laws restricting the sales of stock annt contracts against selling are generally made in connection with contracts for voting at elections so as to control tie manageeont of corporations. Those two classes of contracts, to sell together and to vote together, are closely allied, and consequently are treated under the subject of "Elections," in another part of this work.2
			§ 333. " Pools," " corners," and comilinations in stock.- This sub- ject also is closely connected with the subject of restrictions on the right to vote and pooling arrangements for the purpose of control- ling elections, and consequently is considered elsewhere.3
			§ 334. Contract for (ale of stoc7k Iay be valid without delivery or specific time for eivcery -- Construction of va&#x0027;rious con tracts.-- Gen- erally a sale of stock is attended with an immediate delivery of the certificates therefor, or it is agreed that the certificates shall be delivered at some specificl&#x0027; time in the future. If, however, the vendor offers to sell his stock and the vendee accepts the offer, the contract is complete and binds both )parties, although nothing has been said as to the time when the certificates of stock shall be de- livered. The law implies that the contract will be performed by a delivery of the certificates immediately or within a reasonable time, and either party may insist upon carrying out the contract.4 l Mobile Mut.

Mid- dleton, 29 Beav. 046 (1801); Brightwell v. Mallory, 10 Yerg. (Tenn.) 100 (1830). 2 See 622, infra. See § 0621a, 022, infra. (" The performance of a contract., or the tender of performance, is no part of the contract. The making of a con- tract is one thing, but the perform- ance thereof, or the tender of perform- ance, is another and quite different thing. The contract set up in the par- agraph in question is an executory one, by which the plaintiff agreed to sell tu the defendant the shares of the stock,
			7&#x0027; an.l the defendant agreed to pay. him tlerefor the sum of $25. No time was fixed for the performance; the law will imply, therefore, that it was to be per- formed immediately, or perhaps within a reasonable time. Had a future day been agreed upon for the performance of the contract on each side, there could have been no doubt as to its va- lidity, or the right of either party to enforce it, lie having done all he was required to do on his part. The fact that no time was agreed upon for perform- ance does not change the character of the contract. The contract did not pass any title to the stock, but it was, never- theless, a valid contract, and one which either party can enforce, he having been in no default himself." Bruce v. Smith, 44 Ind. 1 (1873); Kerchner v: Gettys, 18 S. C. 521 (1882); Cheale v. Kenward, 3 De G. &#x0026; J. 27 (1858) Usage may determine what is a reasonable

			tain stock, deliverable at seller&#x0027;s option, within a specified time, a sale inlrsCe anti is made, and the vendor assumes to have tile stock and to hold it for the benollt of tile purchaser until delivery.&#x0027; An agreement to purchaso stock when the corporation is created is en- forceable only after a complete and legal incorporation is effected.&#x0027; A sale of stock with an agreement to take it back whenever the vendee desires is an enforceable contract, even though the contract is oral."
			Great dilllulty often arises in determining whether a contract of sale of stock is an executed or is nmerly an executory contract of sale. There are a few general rules on this subject,4 but each con- tract fdr the sale of stock is construed and enforced by the courts is not 3xercised, A. party entitled to such option may have speciflo perform- ance of it. The mutual covenants of the contract are a sufficient consider. atlion to support it. Scruggs v. Cotter- ill, 07 N. Y. App. Div. 583 (1002). A contract of sale of stock, to be delivered in blocks of five shares or more as called for by the vendee, is not an op- tion, but an obligation on the part of the vendee to purchase, and if ie does not call for the stock it miny be ten- dere;l within a reasonable time and the price recovered, and the vendor may obtain judgment and retain the stock un!til payment is made. Cragin v. O&#x0027;Connell, 60 N. Y. App. Div. 330 (1900). An option to sell certain stock at a certain price "on or after three months from November 0, 1801," must be exer- cised within a reasonable time there- after and cannot be exercised seven years thereafter. McCracken v. Harned, 06 N. J. L. 37 (1001). An offer to buy stock, open to acceptance after Jan- uary 1. must be accepted before July 9. Park v. Whitney, 148 MIass. 278 (1889). An option to purchase stock within three years is enforceable, though one party has an option which the other has not. Seddon v. Rosenbaum, 85 Va. 928 (1889). An option running to two persons cannot be exercised by one of them. Pratt v. Prouty, 101 Iowa, 419 (1898). A person holding stock in es- crow under a a option agreement may interplead bettween the parties in in-
			terest if they make conflicting claims. Walker v. Bamberger, 17 Utall, 2110 (1898). WIhre the owner of stock oilers to sell it to a person at a certain price, the ofTor to remnin open until a certain date, the contract is not unilateral, if the latter accepts the offer within tlat time. If the vendor then avoids the vendee so that the vendee is unable to tender the unoney, tender is excused and the vendor may sue the vendee for breach of contract. Guilford v. Mason, 53 Atl. Rep. 284 (R I. 1002). 1 Currie v. White, 45 N. Y. 822 (1871) When the option is exercised, the time of delivery as fixed is as though that time had been specified in the original contract. Kelley v. Upton, 5 Duer, 830 (1856), holds otherwise where the con- tract has also the words "at buyer&#x0027;s option in ninety days." Such a con- tract is executory as to time of passing title, and tender is necessary. 2Childs v. Smith, 55 Barb, 45 (18009). If stock is sold conditionally, and the condition does not happen, the sale is void. Mitchell v. Wedderburn, 68 Md. 139 (1887). 3See § 339, infra. 4A contract of sale of stock was worded as follows:
			I hold of the stock of the Washing- ton and Hope Railway Company $33,250 or 1,350 shares, which is sold to Paul F. Beardsley [the appellee], and which, though standing in my name, belongs to him, subject to a payment 38

			according to the intent of the parties as manifested by the written terms and cond!tions of the contract itself. Various contracts rela- tive to the sale of stock are explained and referred to in the notes below.&#x0027; of $8,000, with Interest at same rate and from same date as interest on my purohaso of Mr. Alderman&#x0027;s stock." The court hold that this was an oxoe cuted contract by which the ownership of the stook passed to the Ilprchaser, with a reservation of title, simply ab security for the purohaso-money-an equitable mortgage. The court pointed *out tie difference between an executed and executory contract of. sale as fol- lows: " If an agreement to sell, tlhe moving party must be the purchaser. If a sale, an executed contract with reser- vationóof security, the moving party is the vendor, the one retaining security. If an agreeinJnt to sell, tile moving party, the purchaser, must within a reasonable time tender performance or make excuse therefor. If an executed contract, a cc&#x0027;npleted sale, then the moving party is the vendor, the secu- rity-holder, and he assumes all the bur- dens and risks of delay. ... It is not always easy to determine whether an instrument is a contract of sale or one to sell; yet certain rules of interpreta- tion have become established. . . Where the buyer is by the contract bound to do anything as a -onsidera- tion, either precedent or concurrent, on which the passing of the property depends, the property will not pass until the condition be fulfill--&#x0027;, even though the goods may have been actu- .ally delivered into the possession of the buyer." Beardsley v. Beardsley, 138 U. S. 262 (1891). i See, in general, Lindley, Company Law, 6th ed., pp. 076-688. An agree- ment of a party to sell bonds for another party at a certain price may be enforced by the party who is to give the bonds to the other party to sell Plumb v. Camp- .bell, 129 IlL 101 (1888). The fact that
			tile corporation loses a largo amount of money after a partner agrees to take stock as a part of Ills hare of tile part- nershlilp assets does not allow hillm to decrease the price which it wns cstl- matedl to be worth. Donalue v. Mlo. Cosl, 70 Iowa, 733 (1886). Only a do facto corporation need he proved. Reynolds v. Myers, 51 Vt. 441 (1870). Thl memoranda of the contract, to- gether with the certificates of stock, are sufficient presumptive e"oidence of the existence of the corporation and the legal issue of the stock. Mann v. Williams, 143 Mass. 804 (1887). Where stock is issued to a person for con- struction work, and he sublets the contract and agrees to divide the stock with others who are to share the expense of construction, they all are liable to the subcontractor. Mc- Fall v. MoKeesport, etc. Co., 128 Pa. St. 259 (1880). Where a prospectus, offer- ing for sale trustee&#x0027;s transferable cer- tificates, states that such certificates represent stock deposited with the trustes, the stock being in an English corporation, the trustee is personally liable if it turns out that the English corporation had a prior lien on the stock to the full exent of its value. The trustee was bound to take notice of the lien created by the by-laws of the English corporation. The rule of caveat emprltor has been relaxed so as to create an implied warranty of title on the part of the seller. Even thoug&#x0027;h the trustee acted as agent, yet, the principal not being disclosed, the trus- tee is liable. McClure v. Central Trust Co., 165 N. Y. 108 (1900). A broker who claims to be acting for an undisclosed principal in contracting for the pur- chase of bonds, and who stipulates that he shall not be personally liable, can- not enforce such contract if in fact lie 739

A stockholder may hold lia- ble in damages a person who has broken his agrooeeent to loan noney to the corporation, the consideration of such agreement having boon furnished by the stockholder. But if the agreement did not provide for any particular du- ration of the loan, only nominal dam ages can be recovered. Kelly v. Falhr ney, 97 Fed. Rep. 170 (180). Where an agreement for tile pooling and voting of stock provides that any holder of trustees&#x0027; certificates may on six months&#x0027; notice demand from the trustee repay- ment of the price which lie paid for the stock, such demand may be enforced by a suit and the money collected from the trustee. Waggaman v. Nutt, 88 MId. 205 (1898). When a subscriber to stock agrees to sell $5,000 worth of the same at its "original cost,"sucil cost is the cost to the subscriber and not the par value, nor the cost including loans by the subscriber to the corporation.

Stewart v. Hunt- ington, 124 N. Y. 127 (1890). An execu- tory agreement by the holder of i note that he will cancel it in payment for stock is a contract by itself, and is no defense to the note. It is not a satis- faction of the note nor a substituted contract. It may, however, give a right to damages. Hayes v. Allen, 160 IMass. 280 (1894).

Even though such tender is made after the day fixed by the contract, yet, if other features of tile contract have been carried out by tho vendor, a tender after the (lay fixed may be suiln- cient.3 An owner of stock, having the option to soil the samo to a person on a certain day, must tender it on that day, even though it is a holiday other than Sunday. The fact that the tender was nad(o later, and the vendco took timq to consider and then returned the stock, and the fact that tile vendee afterwards offered to take a part of the stock, is not a waiver of the tender.&#x0027; Tender need not be made where tlhe ability to make a tender is shown, and the other party refuses to accept tender and denies thu contract.5 In England, where a transfer of shares is to be made by a (deed, it is the duty sometimes of the vendor,6 and sometimes of the vendee,7 to furnish the necessary deed, according to the custom of the market in whichl 1 West v.

No tender is nec- essary under a contract giving tho right to return stock one year after dlate, where, before tie termination of the year, ;ihe original vendor refused tender and ordered the vendee not to return and stated that the stock was worth- less, which was a fact. Williams v. Patrick, 177 lass. 100 (1900). A tender of the stock need not be made by lho vendor if the vendee declines to com- plete the contract on the ground that the contract was not legal. West v. Averill. etc. Co., 109 Iowa, 488 (180). No tender of the stock need be made if the vendor repudiates the contract. Maguiire v. Halsted, 18 N. Y. App. Div. 228 (1897). A tender may be waived.

Stockton v. Russell, 54 Fed. Rep. 224 (1892). For failure to de- liver, the measure of damages is the dilrerenco in te nmarket value at the date of the contract and at the date fixed in the contract for the delivery, or the date of the breach of the con- tract.

A company may give a person an option to sub- scribe for shares of stock in the com- pany.

			§ 830. Diliculty is often experienced in determining what the measuro of damages is for breach of a contract relative to the salo of stock. In certain cases, where the stock has been delivered or ten- dered, the measure of damages is the purchase price fixed by the con- tract itself.&#x0027; The vendor may tender the stock to tho venlde and fore three years from date, certain stock at a certain price, interest to be paid by the vendee in the meanitilie, and the stook to be deposited in escrow, cannot recover the price at the enld of the three /ears if he has not deposited the stock in escrow as agreed. Umfrid v. Brooks, 14 Wash. 075 (1890). An agreeoent of a stockholder that if he sells a certain amount of his stock lie shall sell to another stockholder his re- maini.ig stock does not apply where he transfers only a portion of the first- mentioned stock.

In Mohley t. Morgan. 6 Atl.

			uro of damages would be the dilterenco between the price thus obtained and the contract price; and this refusal is assigned for error. Of course, the seller would be at liberty. after tender and refusal, to adopt this course; but it was not essential to his right of action. The measuire of damages wis the dif. ference between the market price of the stock at the time of the breach and the contract price. This is tle or- dinary rule: but there was evidence that the stock bad no value, and there is no certainty - indeed, no proof - that upon a resale any price could have been obtained for the stock. or that it had any market value when Parker finally refused to take it. Under these circumstances we see no reason why the price agreel to be paid should not be adopted as the measure of damages, if that was the only mode by which full compensation could be made for the breach of contract by the pur- chaser." i67 N.

Drexel, 122 U. S. 487 (1887). The vendor may claim danmages for a breach, il tlat tile vendee does not pay the contract price and take the stock, or lie many bring an action "in erfect for the spe- cific performance thereof," in which case he l must allege readiness to deliver tile stock. Corning v. Roosovelt, 11 N. Y. Supp. 758 (1890). For breach the vendor may tender the stock and then sue for the entire price. The judgment will allow the vendor to retain the stock until the judgment is satisfied. Finlayson vt Wiman, 84 Hun, 357 (1895). Where the vendee agrees to give a note and the stock as collateral, but gives the note only, the vendor may return the note and sue at once for the price. Rennyson v. Reifsnyder. 1 Pa. Dist. Rep. 758 (1892). The court will compel the vendee to take and pay for stock where it would compel the vendor to deliver the stock if he defaulted on the contract to sell. Bumgardner v. Leavitt, 35 W. Va. 194 (1891) Where the vendor gets judgment for the price of the stock sold but not delivered, the court will order him to deposit the stock with the court or lose his judg- ment. McKeever v. Dady, 18 N. Y. Supp. 439 (1892). In Perin .t Megibben, 53 Fed. Rep.
			80 (1890), the court granted specific per- formanco of a contract to soll stock In boehal of the vendor and against tho vendec. Thle court said: "The agree. ment was in form a contract to buy all the shares of stock In the incorporated companies. The languago of the con- tract shllows that the real agreement was to buy certain real estate, togother with the personal property connected with its use for milling and distilling purposes Without discussin tile ques- tion whether tile sale of shares of stook can be specifically enforced in equity, it is suflicient to say that the sale here was in fact a sale of real es- tate, and the circumstance that per- sonalty was included in the sale would not airect the powerofa courtof equity to anlord relief by requiring specifio performance." The measure of dam- ages for breach of a contract to pur- chase stock is tile difference between the contract price and the market value of the stock at the timeand place of delivery, with interest. Corser v. Hale, 149 Pa. St. 274 (1892). Where a vendee refuses to carry out an execu- tory contract for the sale of shares, the measure of damages is the difference between the price as fixed by the con- tract and the value of the stock at the time of tender and refusal of the ven- dee to fulfill. See Barned v. Hamilton, 2 Ry. &#x0026; Canal Cas. 624 t1841): Tempest :. Kilner, 3 C. B. 249(1846), and Stewart :v Cauty, 8 M. &#x0026;W. 160 (1841); Shaw v. Holland, 15 M. &#x0026; W. 186 (1846).

At such sale the vendor may purchase, wide publicity of the notice having been given and full opportunity for competition at the sale having been offered.2 The statute of limitntions may bo a bar to the ac- sell, the agent may recover such profit as he lostthereby. Mlattingly v. Roach, 84 Cal. 207(1800). See also, as to agents, 8134, supra. Where the vendor, after tendering the stock, assumes to be the owner and directs a sale aud gives a proxy to vote, he can recover only the dilference between the market price at the tliln of delivery and the contract price. Hamilton v. Finnegan, 01 N. W. Rep. 1030 (Iowa, 1902). I See tho cases in the preceding note. The vendor&#x0027;s remedies for a breach of a contract to buy stock are: (1) To hold the stock for the vendee and require payment of the entire price; (3) to sell after notice to the vendee and sue for the difference between the contract price and the selling price; (3) to retain the stock and sue for the difference be- tween the contract price and the mar- ket value price. In re Ives, 11 N. Y. Supp. 650 (1890). No tender is neces- sary wlen the suit is for damages and the vendor intends to retain the stock. Nysewander v. Lowman, 124 Ind. 584 (1890). When suit is brought to recover tie price of stock sold, a delivery or tender must be shown. Holmes, etc. Co. v. Morse, 53 Hun, 58 (188D). Where a party is sued on a note lie may recoup by setting up that the note was given to plaintiff on plaintiff&#x0027;s agreement to assign and deliver certain shares of stock, which was not tendered until eight months after the time agreed upon. Hill v. Southwick, 9 R I. 299 (1869). For failure to deliver, the meas- ure of damages is the difference in the

			market value at the date of the con- tract and at the date fixed in the con- tract for the delivery, or the idate of the breach of the contract. The price at which the vondee had resold Is not ad- inissible unless the vendor liad notice thereof. Coffin v. State, 144 Ind. 078 (1896). An agreement to sell a certain amount of stock in a corlloration to be organized with a specilled capital is not fullilled by tendering stock of a corporation with a less capital. Faulk- uer v. Robinson, 70 S. W. Rep. 090 (Tex. 1902). 2 Clews v. Jamieson, 182 U.

Cone v. Dunham, 59 Conn. 145 (1890). A sale of a certificate to the effect that when stock is issued a specified amount will be issued to the holder is a valid sale and is not defeated by the statute of limitations. Meehan v.

Where certain owners of stock place it in the hands of a trus- tee for sale and the trustee invites sub- scriptions thereto, the subscription contract providing for payment of one. third down and the balance when called for, the statute of limitations is no bar to an action for the two-thirds. although six years have elapsed since

			The vendee&#x0027;s remedy for a failure on tho part of the vendor to deliver is an action for damiages or a bill in equity to obtain spe- cillo performance.1 In nlmost all cases, however, his romedy is an action for d(imnages only, inasmuch as specific perforiance of a salo of personalty is rarely granted.
			§ 337. Spleijfo pvlae/bron&#x0027;n(tc( a(s a remedcy for cbreach of a conltrbot to sell .stoc..- It frequently happens that the person who has con- tracted to purchase stock is particularly anxious to procure that stock, and that, under the circumstances of the case, the stock is worth to him a value not to be compensated for by mere money damluages. This cannot happen in the case of a contract to sell securities issued by the government, since they may be easily pur- chased in the market. Accordingly it is well established, both in the first payliient was made. Williams v. Taylor, 120 N. Y. 244 (1800). See also note 0, p. 000, iufra.
			A person entitled by contract to purchase stock of anotlhr may collect daintages agtinst the latter for failure to comply with the terms of the agree- ment. Rand v. Wiley, 70 Iowa, 110 (1880). For failure to deliver, the ines- ure of damages is the difference in the market value at the date of the con- tract and at the date fixed in the con- tract for the delivery, or the date of the breach of the contract. The price at which the vendee has resold is not ad- missible unless the vendor had notice thereof. Coffin v. State, 144 Ind. 578 (1800). The measure of damages in a suit brought by the purchaser of stock for failure of the vendor to fullill is the difference between the contract price and the market value of the stock on the day of delivery. Market quota- tions are evidence of value of stock only when such quotations are based on actual sales. Where there have been no sales. evidence of a bid for the stock is not admissible, unless it is shown under what circumstances the bid was made, and whether it was in good faith and with intent to fulfill. Wildes v. Robinson, 50 N. Y. App. Div. 102 (1900). In a suit by a purchaser of stock for failure of the seller to deliver, the dam- age is the difference between the pur- chase price and the actual value of the
			7a stock. Written reports of the corpora- tion to public officials not purporting to give the value of the property are insufficient to prove value. Patterson v. Plumnier, 10 N. l. Da. 5(1901). Where a person is paid for stock and fails to deliver, the measure of damages for a breach of the contract is what it would cost the party to purchase the stock which he is entitled to. If lie annot purchase it, then the par value of the stock is the measure of value, inasmuch as he would have had to pay that to the corporation in order to have had the stock issued to him. Barnes v. Selig- man, 55 Hun, 39 (1890). Where a ven- dor of stock in a corporation which has a franchise, but nothing else, is en- titled to two thousand shares of full- paid stock at a later date, according to the contract of sale, his measure of damages forfailure of the vendee to deliver the twothousand shares is nom- inal damages, where there was no mar- ket or actual value for the stock. Barnes v. Brown, 180 N. Y. 372 (1892). Where the vendor of stock is unable to obtain the stock for delivery by reason of an injunction against the corpora- tion, the vendee may sue for the return of the purchase-money. Rose v. Soord, 96 Cal. 152 (1892). That damages are a sufficient remedy, see 1 University Law Rev. 218 (1894). 2 See next section.

			England and Almerica, that a contract for tile salo of government securities will not be specifically cnforced by a court of equity, but tho vendee may suo tlh vendor in an action at law for damages for broach of contract.&#x0027;
			§ 338. An entirely different rule prevails as regards contracts for tlhe sale of stock of privato corporations. If tile stock contracted to be sold is easily obtained in the Inarket, and there are no partic- ular reasons why tho e yendoe should have tile particular stock con- tracted for, le is loft to his action for d(amages. But wlhero the valuo of the stock is not easily ascertainable, or tle stock is not to bo ob- tained readily elsewhero, or tlhro is some particular and reasonable cause for the vendee&#x0027;s requiring the stock contracted to be deliv- ored, a court of equity will lecree a specific performance and com- pel the vendor to deliver tile stock.2
			This rule, as applicable to contracts for tho sale of rail way stock, was clearly established in England in 1S41, in the case of Duncuft v. Albreclht."

Newton v. Wooloy, 105 Fed. Rep. 541 (1U00). An agreement of several parties to sell their property to a corporation in exchange for stock of the latter, the a mount of stock going to each to be determined by arbitrators, will not be specifically enforced where the arbitrators have flxod the value in an illegal way. Any party may with- draw from such a contract prior to the time when it has been signed by all. Consolidated, etc. Co. v. Nash, 100 Wis. 490 (1901). Wiere a purchaser of stock knew or had reason to know that the stock was not owned by the vendor per- sonally, but by a firm in which le was interested, the purchaser cannot have specific performance, but will be re- mitted to a court of law. Jones v. Tunis, D)9 Va. 22°0(1901). Specific performance will not be granted at the instance of the purchaser of stock where the pur- chase is from the committee of a pool of such stock, where it is shown that the pooling agreement required a vote of three-fourths of the stock in the pool before a sale could be made, and it is also shown that the contract of pur- chase was partly an option in that the purchaser was to forfeit a deposit lie had already made, in case he did not fulfill, and it being further shown that in another suit the complainant lad stated tile value of the stock, and it be- ing further shown that the purpose of the contract was to obtain control of a large system of railroads, including the

The former stockholder having died, tie court granted specific performance of tihe contract alid coim- pelled his estate to deliver the stock upon payment of the specified price. A

The court said: "One or more stockholders in a corporation may agree to stand to- gether in carrying out an honest busi- ness policy consistent with what they believe to be to the best interests of all the stockholders This was not a pool- ing agreement, to vest the government of thecorporation for a time in certain members of it, or to yield the control to a few who might dominate, regard- less of the interests of the many.

			Specillo performance is often granted as between several parties each of whomi is entitled to a certain part of stock whiceh is re- ceived by or hold in the namle of one of tihem. A court will com- pel llin to distribute the stock in accordance with the contract.&#x0027; Such cases arise often in " pools" of stock, and in selling property to tie company in consideration of stock, and in buying stock in tile iames of other persons or agents. Thus, where parties to a construction contract agreed to divide the stock in a certain way, a court of equity will grant specilic perorlomance and order transfers of tile stock, it having no market value and tle remedy at law be- ing inadequate.?
			Specific performance may also be said to be granted where a corporation is ordered by a court to issue certificates of stock to its stockholders.4 Principles of law somewhat similar to the abiove are involved in suits brought by a purchaser of stock to compel tile corporation to transfer tile stock on tle corporate books," and in suits instituted by claimants of stock against other parties claim- ing tle same stock; 6 or by the cqrporation to recover back stock improperly issued.7 1 Northern, etc. R. R. v. Valwoitlh, 103 Pa. St. 207 (18)9). The court held also that the fact that the contract re- cited that the seller merely claimned to be the owner of the stock did not ren- der the contract so uncertain as to pre- vent specific performance, and that the fact that the contract provided that the buyer purchased only on condition that his examinltion of the books should be satisfactory and should cor- roborate the correctness of a statement as to liabilities, did not prevent specific performance, and that the fact that the seller agreed that all debts of the company should be paid on the day of the transfer did not prevent specilio performance. 2Where it is aigreed between two brothers that one shall buy stock in a corporation in joint account, and this is done, and the one purchasing charges his brother with the cost of the portion
			of the stocl;, and this account is ac- cepted, a suit in equity lies to obtain the stock upon payment therefor, the corporation being a close corporation. Rand v. Whlipple. 71 N. Y.

			:}1l:. Scelatcenlth sectioln o/&#x0027; st(tute of flrads as aS ffctilgsale s of stock.--In England the rule is firinly establishod that thi seven- teentli section of the statute of frauds, relating to contracts for tilo sale of "goods, wares, and ierchandiso." (does not apply to sales of stuck. No delivery, payment of earnest mioney, or imoiiiorranduli in writing is necessary in order to render tile contract of sile valid. This principle of law was doubted in the early eases,3 but was deter- mined by the case of Ilumble v. Mitcholl, in 1839.4 In 1s38 tilis question arose in this country, apparently for the first time, and it was decided in Tisdale v. Ilarris,&#x0027; clliefly on the authority of the early English cases, that a contract for the sale of stock was within the seventeenth section of the statute of frauds. This decision has boen uniformly followed in America. ITlo suit is properly in equity. Ash- ton v. Ieggerty, 130 Cal. 510 (1900). Under the slttute of California, even though stock is distributed by execu- tors in accordance with a decree of distribution, and the distributees sell the stock and it is transferred on the booksof the company, nevertheless if tlio decree is reversed on appeal, tilo trans- sers are void and the compalny is liable for dividends paid in the menntime to such purchasers. In a suit by tho exec- utors to recover such dividends tie purchasers need not be made parties. Ashton v. Zeila Min. Co., 134 Cal. 408 (1001). See also r 330, su.pra. 2 Welch v. Welch, 00 S..W.

Other scotions of statltt of fralits (es aff&#x0027;ctilly sales of stolc.- The provision of tile statute of frauds relative to answer- ing for the debts, defaults, or miscarriages of another does not apply to a guaranty that there will be a certain dividend on stockl purchased,&#x0027; nor to broker&#x0027;s relation towards his client.2 The pro- vision of the statute relative to transfers of land does not apply to stock,&#x0027; since shares of stock are personal property.4 A transfer of stock for the purpose of defrauding tle transferrer&#x0027;s creditors is void, and a court of equity will set it aside,2 or the stock may be attached or sol( under execution the same as though no attempt at transfer had been made.0 An oral agreement whereby one party makes a loan to the corporation in consideration of the other party keeping the former in control and giving him an option on the latter&#x0027;s stool dloes not sustain a suit for (dmages, even if broken by the latter, inasmuch as it is void, under the statute of frauds, as not to be performed witliin a year.?

What are wageir stoc sales.- Executory contracts for the sale of stock may be made with an intent to actually deliver the stock, or they may be made with an intent not to deliver it, but to pity in cash the amount lost or won by the rise or fall of the mar- subscribe by an agreement of a third person to purchase the stock at par at any time may collect from the latter the difference between the price at which the former sells and the par value, the latter having declined to per- form. Lewisv. Coates, 93 Mlo 170 (1888). See also § 334, supra. A memorandum, "We agree to pay A. Rampacker the par value of this stock . . . upon the surrender of this certificate" in- dorsed on the &#x0027;back of the certificate enables him to tender the stock and collect the par value, even though there was no consideration for the promise. Wheaton v. Rampacker, 3 Wyo. 441 (1891). An agreement of persons hold. ing a majority of the stock, they being directors also, that a person purchasing stock from them shall be general man- ager, and may at the end of two years sell the stock back to them at a stated price, is contrary to public policy and void. The vendors need not repurchase. The arrangement is unfair to the cor-

S. 4009 508 (1881), th court saying: "Tile gener- ally accepted doctrine of tills country is . . . that a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered at a future day is validl. evel though tih seller has not the goods nor any other means of get- ting them than to go into the market and buy theml; but such a contract is only valid when the parties really in- tend und agree that hie goods rre to be delivered by the seller and the price to be paid by the buyer; and if under guise of such a contract the real intent be merely to speculate in the rise or fall of prices, and tih goods are not to be deliveredl, but one party is to pay to the other tile difference between tie contract price and the market price of the goods at the dato fixed for execut- ing the contract, then the whole trans- action constitutes nothing more than a wager, and is null and void. And this is now the law in England by force of the statute of 8 and 9 Vict., c. 109, § 18, altering the common law in that respect." In England it is held that although the parties may have contem- plated that, as a whole, there would be a mere payment of differences between them, yet, inasmuch as the actual con- tracts entered into involved the liabil- ity for the actual delivery of the stock dealt with, they were not gaming or wagering transactions.

A wager contract is not proved by tle fact that the party solling stock to be delivered at a futuro timo intends to purchase that amount of stock in time for the delivery, or vico rverua. "An executory contract for the sulo of goods for future do- livery is not infected with the quality of a wager by reason of the fact that at Its dlate tho vendor had not tile goods, anid had not en- tered into any arrangement to provide them, and had no expecta- tion of receiving thlom, unless by subsequently going into the imar- ket and buying them.n" A bounfidle salo of grailn deliverable in a certain month, on a day to be fixed by seller, is not a gambling contract.5
			§ 342. Statutes prohibiltig ctayer contracts, and also ccrtain stock contlracts.--There are two classes of statutes affecting stock i Flagg t. Baldwin, 38 N. .J. Eq. 210 (18.1). See also Justh v. Holiday, 13 Mlackey, 8,10 (1883) A purehaso on margin is gambling per se. Cover v. Smitl. 82 M1. 580 (1890). A broker can- not enforce a contract between him- self nnd his customer, where the cus- tomer testinfes that he put up $100 as a margin tor one hundred shares of stock. and that if the stock advanced a point lie would havea profit, and if it declined a point lie would lose the $100, and also another $100 to be paid. Billingslea .z Smith, 77 Id. 504 (1893). 2Sampson v. Campordown Cotton Mills. 82 Fed. Rep. 833 (1807).
			In Ashton v. Dakin, 7 W. R. 384 (1859), the court held it not to be a wager contract to order a broker to buy stock, "and let the bargain be so as to the day of payment that you may have an opportunity of reselling it for me by such a day, when I expect the market will have risen, and then you will pay the seller for me with the money you receive from the purchaser, and I slill receive the gain from you, if any, or pay you the loss." So, also, Smith v. Bouvier, 70 Pa. St. 325 (1872), holds that stocks bought and sold upon specula- tion are not necessarily wager contracts. A person may sell without owning the stock, and at time of delivery buy to de-
			liver, and yet the transaction be not a wager, where the jury finds that there was an intent to deliver In both tho sell- ing and buying. See also Thacker v. Hardy. L. R. 4 Q. B. D. 085 (1878): Saw- yer v. Tnggart, 14 Bush (Ky.), 727 (1879). In Massachusetts it is held that the contract is not gambling merely be- cause there was an expectation that only differences would be settled. Barnes v: Smith, 159 Mass. 344 (1893). Where the seller of grain does not in- tend to deliver the property sold, but simply to settle the difference in price, the transaction is illegal under a stat- ute, whether his brokers and the pur- chaser knew of his intention or not. Margins lost in such transactions can- not be recovered back. Connor r. Black, 132 Mo. 150 (1890). A purchase of corn may be legal although miade to fill cer- tain sales which the party had made previously. A mortgage given to a broker for advancements made in the transaction is valid. Douglasv.

			sales cannot be enforced.&#x0027; A state statute declaring illegal all op- tions to sell or buy at a future tinme is constitutional, oven though it may interfere with what would otllhrwise be legitimate con- tracts.2 The California constitutional provision making void all contracts for sales of stock on a margin and providing for recovery back of money paid on such contracts is constitutional, oven though it applies to bona .lidl transactions as well as gambling transac- tions.3 In New York, the statute of 1812,4 re-enacted in the lce- vised Statutes of 1828,1 prohibiting short sales, was repealed by implication by the statute of 1858, declaring the sale to be valid though there be no consideration or payment of consideration, or no ownership by the vendor of such stock at the time of the sale. Various other states have statutes on this subject." Where a cus- tomer gives to his broker in Missouri an order to buy stock and the order is executed in New York, the statute of Alissouri render- ing illcgal tho purchase of stock without intent to pay for the same does not apply, but the common law, which is presumed to be tle law of Now York, dlos apply, and the transaction is legal. More- over, proof that one of the parties intended the contract to be gambling does not invalidate the transaction, and the broker may recover from the customer his losses.7 In California the question (1889). The statute against cornering the market applies to a purchase of corn to raise its price. Soss v. Cum- nings, 149 Ill. 353 (1894). Under the Illinois statute a suit by one stock ex- change firm against another stock ex- change firm for damages for failure to purchase stock, in accordance with a contract made on the. exchange, fails where it is shown that by the rules of the exchange differences are paid in- stead of the stocks being delivered, and other evidence in the case shows that there was no intent to deliver.

			stock gambling that it is a difficult and delicate task to frame ta statute that will cure the evil. The great (tlnger is that any such statute will interfere with legittmate transactions-transactions whlichl for many years have been building the railways and devel- oping tlhe material resources of the country.l
			U§ 9341. &#x0027;Tel O tlist f of ftoc7 tr, locotctiois.--Although, as nl- ready stated, stock sales, where no delivery, but merely a settle- ment of gain or loss, is intended, are wagers, and although such wagers are void by the statutes of some states, and by the rules of public policy in others,2 yet dilllculty is experienced in determining whether tle parties really intended to deliver til stock or to pay dilerrences. The question of intent is always (lilfcult of ascertain- ment and of positive proof. It is pre-eminently a question for the jury. It is accordingly found in most of the cases involving the question whether the transaction was stock gambling, that the court submitted to tlhe jury whether an actual delivery of tie stock was intended or not. If there was no such intent, then, as a mat- ter of law, the transaction was a wager. If a wager, it is, by statute in some states, by public policy in others, a void transac- tion, and the parties have only the rights given them on void con- tracts.3
			§ 344. WVhen intent to tdlirer is question for t1e jury atlnd wcle niot.- The question whether the parties to an executory sale of stock intended to actually deliver the stock, or merely to pay stocks shall be delivered, but only that "differences" shall be paid, the fact that the contract provides that either party may require completion of the purchase and delivery or receipt of the stock does not prevent the transaction from being a ganirrg and wagering contract within the Gaming Act, 1845 (9 &#x0026; 9 Vict.. c. 109), and therefore void. Universal, etc. Exchange v. Strachan, [1896] A. C. 166, holding also that secu. rities deposited in connection with such a contract may be recovered back. 1 Dos Passos, Stock Brokers &#x0026; Stock Exch. (1882), p. 405, says: &#x0027;The history of these stock-jobbing acts seems to prove conclusively that they have never been effective in preventing speculations in stocks. In almost every instance in .which they have heen adopted, after lingering for years on the books, scorned and violated by &#x0027; the unbridled and defiant spirit of specu-
			lation,&#x0027; despite the earnest efforts of the courts to enforce them, they have finally been repealed. It is. perhaps, bet- ter to allow the evil to correct itself, as it surely does, than to bring theadmin- istration of justice into contempt by filling the books with useless laws, which are at all times openly violated and laughed at, and which seem hardly more effective to prevent the practices at which they are aimed than legisla- tion directed against the laws of nat- ure." 2 Particularly in Pennsylvania are such stock wagers void by public pol. icy.

Tloe parties may bo asked directly whether they intendedl that ta delivery shoull beo made. If one party intended to havo a deloivery tlo transaction is valid, even though tio other lparty intended other- wise.Y As between a lparty and his broker, however, greater dif- ficilty arises, and in some jurisdictions the intent between thoem governs their relations, irrespective of the intent of the party deal- ingl with theli.4 &#x0027;Tlo linancial responsibility of tlio parties,5 and IWlhitesides v.

If either of the parties intends, at the close of a series of transactions in buying and
			selling stocks. to accept or make actual delivery of tlle remaining stock, the transaction is not gambling, as between the customer and broker, although tih buying and selling are done upon a mar- gin in the hopo of prolit from the fluc- tultions. Dillaway v. Alden, 88 Me. 230 (185). Tle intent of the principal not to have deliveries but to pay dif- ferences does not invalidate a note given ill settlement, where there is no proof of any such intent on the part of the brokers. Winward v. Lincoln, 51 Atl. Rep. 100 (R. I. 1002). A gambling intent on the part of one party is im- material where tlero was no such in- tent on the part of the other party. McCarthy v. Weare, etc. Co., 01 N. W. Rep. 33 (Minn. 1902). The fact that a broker advanced all the money except the margin, and never delivered any stock excepting on one occasion, and remitted gains and collected losses on various occasions, is evidence to prove that the contract was a gambling con- tract.

			§ 3-45. G&#x0027;amblin, stock contracts (as afflleti, thi relations betwcen the lsriciltal and his brokel.- A bro rker is but an agent of his prin. cipal. As such iho may hold tile principal liable for commissions and for losses paid on stock transactions where those stock trans- actions are legitimate and legal. Where, however, tho stock con- tracts are of a wager or gambling nature, a more dilficult question arises, and the decisions are irreconcilable. In England, in 1S78, Judge Lindley, in Tlhaker v. Ilardy,3 a carefully-considered case, hold that, where the principal has been carrying on gambling trans- actions, he cannot escape or repudiate his liabilities to his broker in those transactions, oven though the latter know of the gambling character of tile business. Tlle principal is liable to his broker as though the transactions wore free from such objections. This is thel well-established rule in England.4 one of the parties is already under obli- gation to other parties to purchase cot- ton several tilmes greater in value than bis fortune is evidence of an intent to gamuble. Beadles v. McElrath, 85 Ky. 230 (1887). Tie fact that a party is financially unable to pay for property is evidence that the contract is gam- bling. Myers v. Tobias, 10 Atl. Rep. 041 (Pa. 1889). 1 Kirkpatrick v. Bonsall, 72 Pa. St. 155 (1872); Beveridge v. Hewitt, 8 111. App. 407 (1881); Irwin tv Willlar, 110 U. S. 499 (1884). Contra, Tomblin v. Callen, 09 Iowa, 229 (1880). The jury, in passing upon the defense to a note that it was given in a stock-gambling operation, may consider all the acts and accounts and the actual dealings. Gaw v. Ben- nett, 153 Pa. St. 247 (1893). As to the competency of evidence herein, and that evidence of custom of settling by differences is incompetent, see Scofield v. Blackmarr, 4 Atl. Rep. 208 (Pa. 1880). Proof of intent to deliver may be by the conduct of tile parties as well as the contract. Press v. Duncan, 100 Iowa, 855 (1896). 2Dewey, Contracts for Future De- livery, p. 207, says: "All the cases ex-

According to these ex- cepted cases, option contracts are pre- sumed to be invalid, and proof must be made that they are bona fide." See also Dewey, Contracts for Future Delivery, p. 46. In Illinois the burden of proof is on the defendant to prove a gambling intent on the part of both parties. In Wisconsin a contrary rule seems to prevail. See Ward v. Vosburgh, 31 Fed.

			0. FRAUDI AS AFFEICTIO A SALEi OF STOCK. § 349. Extent ofel!t of su&#x0027;ject tretlrd lirein.-In a previous chapter of this treatise the effect of fraud and fraudulent representations on a subscription for stock was fully treated. There is little difference in the principles of law governing fraud as affecting sales of stock from fraud as affecting subscriptions for stock. aMost of tile cases assume that the same principles apply to both kinds of transactions. Consequently, the questions of what constitutes fraud heroin; what remedies tie defrauded person has; and the general principles gov- erning this branch of the law, will be fully understood only by a comparison of these two parts of this work.3
			§ 350. lPWhat 7(ts been held to costitute a frau(d 7Icreji.-Itisdif- ficult to lay down rules as to what does and what does not amount to fraudulent misrepresentations. The courts, consequently, let each case stand upon its own facts. Certain states of fact have, however, been passed upon as constituting fraud, and as such they aid in coming to a conclusion on facts in somewhat similar cases. Thus, it has been held to be a fraudulent representation to make false statements as to the location, explorations, and developed state of a mine;4 or that a patent owned by the company was of great value, and that certain other persons were owners of stock; lently overstates the losses, he is liable to account for the amount fraudulently allowed him. Wells v. McGeoch, 71 Wis. 196 (1888). I Jamieson v. Wallace, 167 Ill. 388 (1897). 2 Min7esheimer v. Doolittle, 00 N. J. Eq. 394 (1900) 3 See chi. IX, stpra. In the important case of Western Bank v. Addie, L R. 1 I. L (Sc.) 145 (1807), part of the shares had been subscribed for and part pur- chased. The courts applied the same principles to both.
			4 Morgan v. Skiddy. 02 N. Y. 319 (1875). In Crocker tr Manloy, 104 111. 2°8 (1890), the court held that it was not fraudu- lent to represent that the mines owned by the company were rich and would pay more than twenty per cent. divi- dends, and that the ore on hand was of a certain value, where it is shown that the vendee made a personal exanmina- tion and was satisfied, and no actual fraud is shown. Rescission was re- fused. b Miller v. Barber, 60 N. Y. 558 (187). 782

			Cazexoa- v. Mall, 25 Barb. 578 (1857). False representations as to solvency and financial condition of the corporation are material, and the purchaser may testify that lh would not have pur- chased the stock except for the rep- resentations. Pridlham v. Weddington, 74 Tex. 854 (1889). It is fraud to state falsely that the company is prosperous, that there was no stock for sale. and that defendant was selling stock of others and not his own. Miller v. Cur- tiss, 18 N. Y. Supp 604 (1891). 2 Southwestern . RE v. Papot, 07 Ga. 075, 003 (1881), the court saying: "It is, we think, sufficient to show that the misrepresentation or suppression of fact was of such a nature as to prove that the property purchased was of no value to the purchaser for the purposes for which it was bought, or that it would be reasonable to suppose that the pur- chaser would not have contracted for it had he had knowledge of tih exist- ence of this defect." It is fraudulent to make misstatements to the effect that the corporation is out&#x0027;of debt and is making certain profits It is no defense that the defendant might have ascer- tained the facts from the corporation. Redding v. Wright, 49 Minn. 822 (1892). A misrepresentation as to the amount of corporate indebtedness is material. lMElwee v. Chandler, 108 Pa. St. 575 (1901). A jury decided that a false rep- resentation, on the part of corporate officers, that the company was without debt, was a fraud on the vendee, and held its perpetrators liable in damages. Faville v. Shelian, 08 Iowa, 241 (1885). Where a corporation issues bonds hav- ing the words printed on their face " first-mortgage bonds," when, as a mat- ter of fact, there was an underlying

			mortgage wlhich the plarty to whom tie bonds were sold agreed to pay, but did not pay, except in part, the oillcers and the directors who took part in tie issue of the bonds are liabie to an innocent purchaser who relied on the statemlent contained on the face of the bonds His measure of damages is the dilror- once between the value of the bonds as first-mortgage bonds and socond-mort- gage bonds. Bank v. Byers, 131 Mo. 027 (1817). A purchaser of bonds and stock may rescind on the ground that the vendor falsely represented that there was but one mortgage on the property. It is immatterial that the vendor paid off the other mortgage after suit was brought. Stevenson r. Marble, 84 Fed. Iwkp. 23 (18!7). A purclhaser of a major- ity of the stock of the corporation from a stockholder may rescind where a mis- representation was made tlht the cor- poration had practically no debts. Mer- ritt v. Erilman, 110 Ala. 278 (1897). 3 Gerhard v. Bates, 20 Eng. L. &#x0026; Eq. 129 (1853). Representations that divi- dends would soon be paid are not fraud- ulent, but statements as to present con- dition and prospects may be for the jury. Warner v. Benjamin, 89 Wis. 290 (1895). 4See further illustrations in ch. IX, sipra. Declaring a dividend in good faith and sound discretion is not fraud by reason of its turning out to have been ill-advised. Burnes v. Pennell, 2 H. L. Cas. 497 (1849). A representation that the stock &#x0027;"is good property or in- vestment and is about to make a divi- dend" is a false representation when untrue, and where the person taking the stock as trustee from a preceding trustee objected to receiving it on ac- count of his doubt or ignorance as to

A confiden- tial agent who uses his position to ob- tain stock of which the principal has been deprived wrongfully must turn it over to the principal. Hardenbergh v. Bacon, 33 Cal. 356 (1807) Statements that a large part of the capital stock had been &#x0027;aken by the parties them- selves, and that the parties themselves would continue the management of the concern, and concealment of tle fact that a large quantity of the stock was to be issued for the good-will of the business, and statements leading to the conclusion that all subscribers for stock stood on an equal footing, consti-

Anglo.Am. etc. Trust Co., 72 nun, 331, 841 (1803). I Tlat it is not, see Union Nat. Bank v. Iunt, 70 Mo. 419 (1882). A false rep- resentation that the stock sold is worth eighty cents on the dollar-it being worth but forty cents--will not sus- tain an action for deceit. Ellis r. An- drews, 50 N. Y. 83 (1874). A represen- tation as to the value of stock is mato- rial where the vendor was a director, and evidence may be introduced to show that the stock was issued for property at an overvaluation and that some of the stock was issued without being paid for. Slhelton v. IIealy, 50 Atl. Rep. 742 (Conn. 1901). It is fraudl- lent to represent that the stock is worth par whlen in fact it is wortllless. If the vendor persuades the vendee to make no inquirie.s the latter may recover, although he made none. Tle measure of damages is not the value of the land given for the stock, but the difference between the actual and the represented value of the stock. Nysewander v. Lowman, 124 Ind. 584 (1890), False rep- resentations may consist of statements that the stock is worth a certain price and is sold to plaintiff at a reduced price in order to obtain his services. Maxted v. Fowler, 94 Mich. 100 (1802). False statements as to the value of stock and the dividends it would pay and the purpose for which it was in- corporated are sufficient to sustain re- scission.

			is fraudulent for a vendor to represent that ho is selling the stock of others, when in fact llo is selling his own stock.&#x0027; Statements that tho stock sold is treasury stock, nnd that others paid tlo same price to the treasury, are material.&#x0027; A representation as to th0 cost of the stock, with an agreemont to sell at cost, is (liferent from an agreement to sell at a fixed figure which is represented to bo cost. A misrepresentation as to the cost of tlo stock to the vendor is not actionable.3 Although a contractor, taking stock and bonds in payment for work, subcontracts tlh work for the stock and then forecloses the mortgage and buys in the property, tho subcontractor cannot hold him liable for the stock.&#x0027; The fact tlhat the only property that tlh company owns consists of worth- less patents, being infringements on other patents, is no defenso to notes given for stock, there being no warranty or fraud. The value is immaterial.&#x0027; A vendor of stock is not bound to tell tho vendee the company is insolvent, even though the former know that fact at that time;0 nor is the vendee bound to tell what he "non.assessable," when in fact it was not legally paid up, renders liable for false representations the president and secretary who made such sale or pledge and who knew that it was not paid-up stock. Windram v. French, 151 Mass. 547 (1800). A suit by the purchaser of stock for damages for fraud, in that the stock had been fraudulently paid up by property conveyed to the corporation at an overvaluation, is barred by the stat- ute of limitations applicable to frauds Smith v. Martin, 135 Cal. 247 (1001). A statement filed with the state commis- sioner as required by statute, in regard to the amount of the paid-up stock, is not such a representation as will sustain an action for damages for fraudulent representations inducing a person to take the notes of the company.

			There are various facts which constitute fraud herein, and vari- ous principles of law applicable to the remedy to be pursuedo. Sucl cases are arising constantly, and are given in the notes below.0 insolvent at the tino the contract was entered into. Rudge v. Bowinail, L. R. 8 Q. IB. 689 (1808): Gordon v. Iarkier, 10 La. 50 (1830), where the question of whether fraud was involved was sub- mitted to the jury. Crabb v. Miller, 19 W. R. 419 (1871), where, by reason of a winding up, a transfer on the corporate books was no longer possible; Kerch- ner v. Gettys, 18 S. C. 521 (1882), holding that a loss by the corporation of its property is no defense. Damages can- not be recovered for the breach of an executory contract to purchase stock, if at the time of making the contract the corporation had been dissolved and the purchaser was not aware of that fact. Kip t. Monroe, 29 Barb. 579 (1859). The fact that stock was worth- less at the time of the sale thereof is no defense to an action for the purchase price, unless there was fraud or a spe- cific warranty. Peck, etc. Co. v. Strat- ton, 95 Fed. Rep. 741 (1899). A person who pays for land by transferring worthless mining stock is not a bona fide purchaser. Sewell v. Nelson, 67 S. W. Rep. 985 (Ky. 1902).

Rep. 72:1 (Ky. 1902). 1 A sale of stock July 6th, "including all dividends due or to become duo thereon," carries a stock dividend de- clared June 5th and payable to stock- holdersof record July 1st, and the sale is not fraudulent although the seller did not know of such stock-dividend and the buyer did know. Rose v. Bar- clay, 191 Pa. St. 594 (1899). 2 IIoxie v. Small, 80 Me. 23 (1893). 3 Kilgore v. Bruce, 106 Mlass. 130 (1890). 4Traphagen v. Sagar, 03 Minn. 317 (1895).

			[§ 3s0. Fraud in the sale of stock frequently arises in the organization of the company. The parties who cause the coinpuny to be organ- lep. 729 (1887). It is a question for the jury whether it was fraud ill represelnt ing that the stock was paid up, whlen in fact tIhn first paymnont only had been imade, anIl the balance Ilad been palid by dividoends. Kryger v. Andrews, 65 Mlici. 405 (1887). Friud mniay be by directors in fraudulently making div- ideunld. Seo oll. XXXII, iafra. Where 1r person owning all the stock of a cor- poration sells it under circumstances whlich induce the purchaser to believe that the former has no claim ngainst tie corporation, he may be enjoined fromlenforcing any such claiin. Griven rt Tilmes-Repiublican, etc. Co., 114 Fed. Rep. 92 (1902). Where, after an agree- mient to sell land for stock, the owner of the stock attends a corporate meet- ing and votes to sell all corporate prop- erty at sixty cents on the dollar, whlich is done, the purchaser of the stock may have the land returned. Harris v. Piatt. (4 Mich. 105 (1887). Cases of fraud on the part of the vendee some- times occur, whore the vendee is given a majority of the stock, and then uses his control of the corporation to de- fraud the vendor in the execution of his contract to payfor the stock. Har- denbergh v. Bacon, 33 Cal. 305 (1807); Johnson v. Kirby, 05 Cal. 482 (1884). Where a stockholder sells a controlling interest to a person who is to piay there- for by improving the corporate prop- erty, but who elects a board of direct- ors and defrauds the vendor, the latter&#x0027;s remedy is a difficult one. Cates v. Sparkman, etc. Co., 73 Tex. 019 (1889). The vendor cannot rescind ol the ground that the vendee said that lie was buying for himself alone and such was not the case. Downs v. Self, 67 S. W. Rep. 897 (Tex. 1902). The fraud or mistake must have been such that the agreement would not have been made in its absence, where a rescission of the contract is sought by decree.
			MIeans v. Roes, 20 Fed. leop 210, 210 (1880). Even though an inventor Is persuaded to turn in his inventions to a corporation for stock on an oral assur- ance that plenty of money would bo forthcoming to take the stock of the company and make the business sue. cessful, and even though the parties making such representations do not advance the money, but allow the com- pany to become insolvent and buy in the assets, including the patents, yet the inventor can not maintain an action for fraud in failing to furniish money according to promiise. Snith v. Parker, 148 Ind. 127 (1897). A promise of em- ployment is not fraud, even though not performed. Hubbard t. Long, 103 Mich. 442 (1894). Fraud may be by the agent&#x0027;s representations as to the cost of min- ing the coal, of transportation, and of the market price. Booth v. Smith, 117 111. 370 (1880). On a question of testi- mony by the defendant, see Reeve v. Dennett, 141 Mass. 207 (1886). It has been held that one who was induced by fraud to purchase stock in an insolvent corporation may bring suit to have his part of the corporate assets ascertained, to the exclusion of a debt due from the corporation to the person inducing him to purchase. Poole v. West Point, etc. Assoc., 30 Fed. Rep. 513 (1887). A person making sales of stock by false representations may be indicted for ob- taining money by false representations. Commionwealth v. Wood, 142 Mass. 459 (18S6). The statute of frauds as to the answering to the debt, defaults, etc., of another person has no application to a sale of stock herein. The fact that the corporate property sold several years later for a small amount is immaterial and not admissible. French v. Fitch, 07 Mich. 492 (1887). A misstatement as to the reason why the vendee pur- chases is not material. Byrd v. Raut- man, 85 Md. 414 (1897). Where an in-

Whero an agent to sHll a mine indlllces his principals to place in his nallo all their stock and lie sells the property and ac&#x0027;counts to theml for part only of the price, and refuses to return the stock, they may sue him for au accounlting withoult previously ten- dering back tie amiount they received or doinanding the stock. Wooster v. Nevills, 73 Cal. 58 (1887). False representations as to the corpo. rate property, business. and prospects, and the use of a corporate prospectus which the vendee knows contains false statements, sustain rescission of a trans- ser of land for stock. A person pur- chasing the land with full knowledge of the fraud is not protected. Tle cer- tificates may be filed with tie clerk of the court, awaiting the retransfer of tle land. Ormsby v. Budd, 72 Iowa, 80 (1887). Tlhe vendee of stock cannot re- scind or collect damages on the ground that the corporation was not legally in- corporated. If it is a de facto corpora- tion the vendor is not liable. Harter v. Eltzroth, 111 Ind. 159(1887).

A managing director who buys stock on credit, and then aids in levying an attachment on the stock against the vendor and conceals tho same from the vendor, and buys in the stock at a low price, and then repudi- ates his debt to the vendor, is guilty of fraud. Young v. Fox, 37 Fed. Rep. 385 (1888). Where the president in selling stock makes false representations, the

Nelson tv Luling, 02 N. Y. 045 (1875), aif&#x0027;g 80 N. Y. Super. Ct. 514. A statemenlt on April 10 that tle last senli-lannual dividend was seven per cent., nnd tlhat tile l(scal year ended on June 1, is a fraudulent suppression of the truth where but one dividend lhnd been declared, and that twenty-two months before the date of the state- ment. Tyler v. Savage, 143 U. S. 79 (1892). Where tie contract of salecon- tains express warranties, parol repre- sentations as warranties are not ad- mitted to prove false representations. Humphrey v. Merriam, 40 linn. 413 (1891). Tle fact that statements as to the affairs of tle company are not filed as required by statute does not amount to fraud in the sale of stock; nor do representations that the stock will pay twenty per cent. dividends amount to fraud. The question as to the validity of stock having once been litigated cannot be again raised in an action for deceit in the sale of the stock. The mere act of conspiracy is not sufficient to sustain the action unless damage is shown. Robertson v. Parks, 70 Md. 118 (1892). A representation, in a transac- tion involving water-company stock, as to the amount of water that can be obtained is material.

Where stock is issued to several per- sons for a patent, and they return part of it to a trustee for the company to sell for working capital, and a sub- scriber to the company&#x0027;s stock gives his note to tie company, and the com- pany indorses the note to one of the first-named parties, wlho turns out his own stock to fill the subscrip- tion, the latter may recover on the note, and is not liable for false rep- resentations of one of his associates and an agent of the coinpany. King v. Doana, 130 U. S. 100 (1891). A sale of stock will not be set aside on the ground of inadequacy of price unless so gross as to shock the conscience and give decisive evidence of fraud. Perry v. Pearson, 13:5 IlI. 218 (1890). It is not sufficient to prove that defendants managed the manufacturing business of the company, to sustain an action for fraud in stating that the company was doing a good business and making ten, per cent., it appearing that the busi- ness was new, and defendants did not state that they knew of the financial condition. Hatch v. Spooner, 18 N. Y. Supp. 612 (1891). A statement that drill-holes in coal-fields showed cer-

The suit, being at law, failed, because no fraudulet intent was proved. Where two parties exchange securities of various kinds, and in the contract to that effect place a value upon the same, there is no fraud arising from the fact that the value given to particular stocks is greater than their actual value, the transaction really being one of barter.

Long, 105 Mioh. 442 (1805), MisrepresentiltIons as to the value of stock as inlvestillmit and relating chiefly to the future will not sustain an action of deceit. Lynch v. lMurphy, 171 Mlass. 107 (1898). No fraud is proved by showing that tlh certificate of stocl recited the capital stock as being $25,000 when it was clailnd to be $50,000, nor by a general statement that the company&#x0027;s affairs were in good shapo and that it was making money, such statement being practically correct. Ioeft v. Koch, 110 Mich. 458 (1890). It is no defense to notes given in payment for stock that the agent of the vendor stated that lie would not sell the notes and that they could be paid out of future divi- dends. State Bank v. Gates, 114 Iowa, 823 (1901). A stockholder cannot pre- vent other stockholders from selling their stock on the ground that the purchaser may manage the company to the detriment of minority stockholders, and the fact that the plaintiff&#x0027;s stock was on deposit with the trust company and that he cannot get the stock and thus accept the order to purchase his stock also is no ground for an injunc- tion. Ingraham v. National Salt Co., 72 N. Y. App. Div. 582(1902). A purchaser of stock who makes a partial payment and gives back the stock as collateral security cannot abandon the contract and claim such part of the stock as the payment already made would pay for, on the ground that the seller has again obtained control of the cor poration and is guilty of a breach of trust.

			An agent is not liable for misroprescntations made by his prin- cil)al, but it may be a question of fact whether tlh vendor is a principal or agent.&#x0027; A contract in regard to stock may be illegal in itself, as, for instance, a contract to use stock to rob a railroad a:nd bribe a judge.&#x0027; Where a stockholder receives an offer for his stock, and is persuaded not to sell by fraudulent representations of it director, he may lold the latter liable in danmages.3 False repre- sentations made by a committee of the directors inducing parties to purchase a majority of the stock are not binding on stockhold- ers an(l directors who know nothing about such representations. llepresentations of an agent do not bind the seller unless the agent was authorized to make representations." A misrepresentation by an agent of a corporation as to the property lold by it, made to a purchaser of stock, not from the corporation but from a stock- holder, does not render the vendor of the stock personally liable.&#x0027; as such a sale is illegal. Reid v. Cald. well, 110 Ga. 481 (1000); 189 U. S. 200. 1 See § 651, infra. Thus wlere a per- sun purchases property for the sole pur- pose of creating a corporation to take it over from him and to pay him there- for an excessive price in cash and stock, netting a large profit to him, the stock being offered to the public, and lie causes the incorporation to be made and directors to be named, who are his dummies, he is a promoter and can be held liable by such corporation for the profit he has made, unless lie fully dis- closed in a prospectus the fact that he had formed the corporation and that lie had made such profit. Especially is this the rule where the prospectus gave a false impression. He occupies a fiduciary relation towards the purchas- ers of the stock. It is immaterial that the directors approved of tie trans- action with full knowledge. Non-dis- closure in such a case is a misfeasance in the nature of a breach of trust. Re Leeds, etc. Co., 87 L T.

Where tlho vendor Intlaing fraudulent representations ns to tho lfnancial con- dliion of the company is secretary ant treasurer, lie cannot claim that lie was ignorant of tile facts.4 A vendee who is in the employ of the company and has opportunity to know all about it cannot claim that lie was deceived as to tile value of tlhe stockl.

Fraud7luont sale by a(eclt, etc., in breach of trust.- A bona fide purchaser for valuo and without notice of stock from n vendor who delivers teo certificates therofor indorsed in blank by another, or indorsed by the vendor himself, is protected and entitled to thl stock, although it afterwards transpires that the agent was solling as agent of anothor and had been guilty of a breach of trust.&#x0027; But thl transfeoree is not protected where hle is not a bona sild lpur- &#x0027; MoNeil v. Tenth Nat. Bank, 40 N. Y. 38.5 (1871). This is not only the loading caHe onl.ho estoppel of a principal from reputliating tho salo or pledge of his stock by hli algent, whom lh intrusted with the certificates indorsed in blank, but It is one of the leading cases on tho law of the quasi-nlegotiability of stock. See also Ilonold t. Meyer, 30 La. Ann. y58 (1884); Strange v. louston, etc. I. IR, 53 Tex. 103 (1880); Dovey&#x0027;s Appeal, 07 Pa. St. 153 (1881). A Ibotuflide pledgeo of fraudulently issued warehouse re. ceipts can enforce theli only to the extent of the loan and interest. Corn, etc. Bank v. American, etc. Co., 103 N. Y. 332 (100). A bill in equity filed by a partner to hold his copartners and third persons liable for a misalppropria. tion of stock owned by the firm cannot be sustained where it is not alleged that the third persons knew of such misappropriation at the time of such misappropriation. Wall v. Old Colony, etc. Trust Co., 174 Mass. 340 (1899). Even though the agent of a corporation rep. resents to it that a party owns certain property and will sell it to the corpora. tion for $7,500 in bonds and $30,000 in stock, and the purchase is mlade on those terms, and the vendor keeps the bonds and gives the stock to such agent, and the agent sells a lxprtion of the stock to a bomt fitle purchaser, yet the latter cannot rescind the sale on the ground of fraud. Fouishee . Snyder, 54 S. W. Relx 730 (Ky. l00). Whlere four shares of stock are transferred to t person by the corporation to qualify him as a director, and le agrees to re- turn the same to the corporation when ceasing to be a director, but thereafter
			and before he ceases to bo a director ho agrees with the indorsers of his noto that they shall have the stock as col- lateral security, they are protected, even though the stock was actually de- livered to them after they had notice of the first agreement, it being shown, however, that thoy hiad no notice of such agreement at the time they be- caine sureties. Dueler, etc. Co. v. Daugherty, 02 OhioSt. 580(1000). Where a stockholder indorses a ccrtillcate of stock in blank and delivers it to an agent, and the agent pledges it for his own purposes, the pledgee, if lie took without notice of the breach of trust, is protected. The court held also that tlhe statute of 1884 applied to such a case. Russell v. American, etc. Co., 06 N. E Rep. 751 (Mass. 1902). Te bonau fide purchaser of stock froml an agent without knowledge of the agency is protected. Garvin v. Pettee, 88 N. W. 573 (So. Dak. 1901). Where certificates of stock are deposited with the broker, duly transferred in blank, a bonaji&#x0027;le holder of such certificates from the broker is not protected as against tile real owner, where the facts were sutli- cient to give him notice. Rynian r. Gerlacli, 153 Pa. St. 197 (1893); and see many cases in chapter XXV, infra, where this principle of law is often in- volved.

Where a stockholder in an insolvent corporation turns over his stock to another person to deposit under a reorganization agreecnent, tile latter agreeing to pay tlhe assess- ment on the stock and to deliver to tlhe stockholder the new securi- ties upon repayment of such assessment, and lie refuses so to do thereafter, he is guilty of a conversion and of a fraud upon the stockholder.5 Where a customer may rescind a purchase of stock made for him by his broker, upon discovering that the broker sold him stock owned by such broker, the customer, if he has exchanged such stock for reorganization stock, may tender back old stock which he borrows for that purpose.&#x0027; In England the courts do not protect a purchaser of certificates of stock unless the latter has not only purchased, but has obtained a registry on the corporate books.8

This principle of ltaw was lirst clearly established in England in ISim, in the case of D)avidson v. Tulloch. It was there held that there need be no privity between the ollicers issuing the report and the person purchasing shares of stock from third persons.

In such a case the person injured has been subjected to damage by his fraudulent acts, and the fraudulent wrong-doer is liable for the consequences." In Ca- zeaux v. Mali, 25 Barb. 578 (1857), the court said: " It is not essential that the representation should be addressed di- rectly to the plaintiff; if it were made with the intent of its influencing every one to whom it might be communi- cated, or who might read or hear of it, the latter class of persons would be in the same position as those to whom it was directly communicated, but they must have come to a knowledge of it before their purchase." In Morse v. Swits, 19 How. Pr. 275 (1859), a bank officer was held liable for false state- ments in a report published in accord- ance with the requirements of a statute, the court saying: "Being published, the public, or any individual of the pub- lic, has a right to believe it. ... And if, believing it, any one of the public
			acts on that belief, the malnkrs and pub. lslhers of this falsehloodl are to bo held liable for the consequences they have caused." (See cases cited in Reporter&#x0027;s note to the foregoing.) See also Salmon v. Richardson, 80 Conn. 860 (1802); Fenn v. Curtis, 23 Ilun, 884 (1881), holding the secretary liable to a purchaser of shlires from an individual, the secretary having signed the certificate of stock and also a circular stating that the cor- poration was a corporation, when in fact it was not. And see g§ 40, 48, supra. A person buying stock ill what was supposed to be a corporation, but is a partnership, cannot recover back his money from all of the participants. Perry v. Hale, 143 Mass. 540 (1887). A corporation is not liable for misrepre. sentations of the president in selling stock belonging to himself. Prosser v. First Nat. Bank, 100 N. Y. 077 (1887). Where stockholders in an apartment- house corporation are entitled to rent apartments at a rental to be fixed by a majority vote of the stockholders, an increased rental so voted is legal.

The fact that the false statements as to the condition of the corporation are made to a director, who is acting as agent for the vendee, is not fatal to the suit for fraud. Trim- ble v. Ward, 97 Ky. 748 (1895). A per- son loaning money to an individual and taking bank stock as collateral security cannot hold the bank liable in an ac- tion for damages for deceit, on the ground that its published statements were false and fraudulent, and that he relied on those statements.

A cor- poration may be held liable for false representations in a prospec- tus issued by it to sell stock of another corporation.&#x0027; A purchaser of stock in an insurance company, however, cannot hold a bank liable on a misstatelme nt by the bank to tho insurance commissioner as to tile casl which the insurance company has on deposit witl it.&#x0027; An ollicer of ai bank is personally liable to a purlchasr of its stock who relied on the published statement signed by the ollicers in which overdrafts are described as loans and discounts.&#x0027; Although a corporate creditor may hold the incorporators liable for a false statement in their sworn statement obtaining incor- poration in regard to the amount of capital stock that has been paid in, yet the action is in tort and an assigneeof the claim cannot maintain it.4 The president is liable in an action of deceit where he sells stock after referring the purchaser to a published statement of the corporation signed by him, which statement was false. Where, however, the sale is to a director, such a director is bound to show tlat he did not know the statement was untrue, and he may show that fact although he also signed the statement.&#x0027; ing that the corporation has issued a false report that it was earning two per cent. a month, and that the vendee re- lied on this report, is guilty of fraud, and the sale may be rescinded. Foley v. Holtry, 43 Neb. 133 (1894). A person who purchases bank stock from the bank itself may hold the bank liable for damages where the public state. ment of the bank which he relied on in purchasing was false. The measure of damages is the difference between the value of the stock if the statement hlad been true and its acturl value. Ex- change Bank v. Gaitskill, 37 S. W. Rep. 100 (Ky. 1890). A stockholder sued by a corporation on an ordinary debt, and who sets up in defense that he was in- duced to buy stock from outside par- ties by fraudulent stntevmnt.s made by the company, cannot have a mandamus to compel the company to allow him to examine its books.

			§ 353. A somewhat different rule prevails in England as to falso statements contained in a prospectus of a corporation. A prospec- tus is issued for the purpose of inducing persons to subscribe for stock. Its object is not to promote the sale of that stock. Accord- ingly it was decided in Peek v. Gurnoy,&#x0027; in 1873, that "tho pur- chaser of silares in tile market, upon the faith of a prospectus which leo has not received from those who are answerable for it, cannot, by action upon it, so connect himself with them as to ren- der them liable to him for tile nisrepresentation contained in it, as if it had been addressed personally to himself." In Now York a directly opposite rule prevails. In the case of Morgan v. Skiddy,2 in 1875, the court of appeals held that, "if the plaintiff purchased his stock relying upon the truth of the prospectus, he Las a right of action for deceit against the persons who, with knowledge of the fraud and with intent to deceive, put it in circulation. The representation was made to each person comprehended within the class of persons who were designed to be influenced by tile pros- pectus; antl when a prospectus of this character has been issued, no other relation or privity between tile parties need be shown ex- cept that created by the wrongful and fraudulent act of the de- fendantsin issuing or circulating tile prospectus, and tile resulting injury to the plaintiff." It has recently been held in Engl;nd that where a person purchases stock in tile open market, being induced to do so by a prospectus and published telegram, both of which are fraudulent, he may hold the promoters personally responsible, al- though the stock was not purchased from them nor from the cor- poration.3 an action for deceit where he sells stock of the bank of which he is presi- dent, and which has published a false statement of its condition by order of the president and others. Trimble v. Reid. 41 S. W. Rep. 319 (Ky. 1897). In an action at law the directors are not liable to a person who purchases stock, relying on the directors&#x0027; report, unless fraudulent intent is proved. Parker v. McQuesten, 32 Q. B. Rep.

Ken- nedy, 147 N. Y. 124 (1895), it was held that the fact that an officer, in a state- ment of the liabilities of the company omitted a claim which was afterwards established, was not guilty of such fraud as would sustain a suit at-law for damages for deceit. 3 Andrews v.

			[on. xx. § 35&#x0027;. temedies for th7e frlaud.--Tlro are thrco methods by which a person who lhas been fraludulently induced to buy or soil stock may rem(edy the wrong.&#x0027; Ile may bring an action at law for the consideration, or an action at law for dalnages for the lde- ceit, or le may file a bill in equity to have the transaction set aside. The second remedy is the most dillicult and tlh last the rmost easy to maintain. At common law an action to recover back thei whole of the purclihse-money upon a rescission for fraud is virtually a suit for moncy had and roceived.2
			In special cases other remedies are open to the purchaser. Ile nay compel the defrauding party to abide by the statements that were &#x0027;made. Thus, where the vendor represented that the corpo- rate paroperty was unincumbercd, equity may, at the instance of the purchaser of stock, enjoin the vendor from enforcing a lien wllilch he has on such property.&#x0027; If the contract is executory it may bo and giving extracts therefrom, the di- rectors are not personally liable in an action for deceit, oven if it is shown that the reports were prepared on in- structions not from the directors, but from the vendors of the property to the company. It is necessary to prove that the reports were untrue. Angus v. Clifford, [18911 2 Ch. 449. 1 &#x0027; A person who has been induced by fraudulent representations to become the purchaser of property has, upon discovery of the fraud, three remedies open to hiim, either of which le may elect. He may rescind the contract absolutely and sue in an action at law to recover the consideration parted with upon the fraudulent contract. To maintain such action he must first re- store, or offer to restore, to the other party, whatever may have been re ceived by him by virtue of the con- tract. He may bring an action in pqliit.y to rescind the contract. and in that action have full relief. Such an action is not founded upon a rescission, but is maintained for a rescission, and it is sufficient, therefore, for the plaintiff to offer in his complaint to return what lie has received and make tender of it on the trial. Lastly, he may retain what he has received and bring an nc- tion at law to recover the damages sus-

			tained. This action proceeds upon an aflirmance of the contract, and tihe measure of the plaintiff&#x0027;s recovery Is the difference between the article sold and what it should be according to the representations." Vail v. Reynolds, 118 N. Y. 297 (1890). Where the sale of stock has been induced by fraud, the vendee may follow the money paid by him and recover it back if tie identity of the fund can be shown. Moore v. Williams, 62 Hun 55(1891). 2Gassett v. Glazier, 165 Mlass 473 (1890). 3Jones v. Belles, 9 Wall. 304 (1809). See also s§ 334, 354 and 771. Where a person organizes a railroad corloration and takes a contract for its construc- tion, and causes all the stock and a largo quantity of bonds to be issued to him- self, and then sells these stocks and bonds and has knowledge of represen- tations made by corporate officers to his vendee that the company owes noth- ing except the bonds, he cannot after- wards enforce a claim for doing extra work under a contract, where such con- tract did not appear on tihe books of the company. The transaction is a fraud on his part. Chicago, etc. Ry. v. Miller, 91 Mich. 100 (1892). Where the vendor of a majority of the stock of a corpora- tion agrees that the company owes no

			§ 355. Action, olr dcceit.-In order to sustain an action for dam- ages for deceit, whereby plaintiff was induced to buy or sell shares of stocl, it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove that statements debts except certain specific ones, the vendee may recover back any excess of debts over those specified. Where the debts of one class were not to exceed a certain sum, but did exceed that sum, the vendee may recover the difference, even though the debts of another class wore less than a sum specified in the contract of sale. Chicago, etc. Ry. v. Hoyt, 81) Wis 314 (1895). See German State Bank v. Northwestern, etc. Co., 104 Iowa, 717 (1898). Although a pur- chaser of stock cannot rescind. he hav- ing been guilty of delay, yet lie may sue the vendor upon a warranty that the stock will be worth more than what it was sold for. Maxted v. Fowler, 94 3iicli. 100 (1892). Stockholders cannot defeat a vendor&#x0027;s lien on the ground thait the vendor, before they bought their stock, represented that le had no lien, where they do not set up that de- sense in a suit by him to establish his lien. Wilson v. Seymour, 70 Fed. Rep. 678 (1896) Where a person owning all the stock of a corporation sells it under circumstances which induces the pur- chaser to believe Ohi tihe iorlitlr hai: Io claim against the corporation, he may be enjoined from enforcing any such claim. Given v. Times-Republican, etc. Co., 114 Fed. Reip 92 (1902). ¥Where the stockholders in a power company sell their stock and then obtain control of water rightson which the company had an option, which option has expired, the party purchasing the stock may by

			A subscription may be canceled by and with the consent of the directors when fraud is involved. Four years afterwards corporate creditors cannot attack it. McDormott tr Harrison, 9 N. Y. Supp. 184 (1890). See ch. X, st)ra. If there has been a mutual mistake in regard to what the stock really repre- sented in property, an action for money had and received or a suit to cancel the sale will lie. Norton v. Bohart, 105 Mo. 01.5 (1891). 2 Wallace t Hood, 89 Fed. Rep. 11 (1898). See also § 103, supra. A sub- scriber to the stock of a national bank cannot, after the bank has become in- solvent, avoid his statutory liability on the stock by the defense that lie was induced by fraudulent representa- tions of the bank and its officers to be- come a stockholder. Scott v. Deweese, 181 U. S. 202 (1901). In a suit at law brought by the receiver of a national bank against a stockholder on his stat- utory liability, he cannot set up fraud on the part of the bank in inducing him to subscribe. That defense, if good at all, is available only by a suit in equity. Neither can the defendant set up a counterclaim for the money so paid by him for the stock. Lantry v. Wallace, 182 U.

			wore made or acts done which were fraudulent, that tile person guilty of thlen know that they were fraudulent, and that tilo plaint- iss acted on suclh statements or acts in buying or selling tlho stock. In England a statement made recklessly, or without regard as to whether it is true or untrue, may constitute a fraudulent intent.2 Y. 79 (1807), tile venlee sued the vendor for a breach of warranty, alleging tlat the vvtllor&#x0027;s agetnt lmade certain rep. resonttioins as to tile condition of the corporation. The action failed on the ground that the vendor did not author- ize the agent to make a warranty. In Ayres v. French, 41 Conn. 112 (1874), tile court held tiat fraud, inducing the owner of stock to part withl it. may be remedied by the action of trover, with n count in case for a fraudulent pro- curement and conversion of the stock. In National Exch. Co. t. )rew, 2 lMacq. (H. L) 103 (1855), it was held that where a person is induced by the fraudulent reports and representations of corpo- rate officers to purchase stock, and the corporation loans hin money to do so, it cannot recover back the money loaned. See Lightfoot t. Creed, 8 Taunt. 268 (1818), holding that the vendee should declare, not for money paid, but specially on the contract. Fraud in the purchase of stock is not a good defense to a note given for such stock for tle purchase price, unless it is averred that the purchase was in- duced by the fraud and that the pur- chaser was ignorant of the truth of the misrepresentations made. Spencer v. Johnston, 58 Neb. 44 (1899). l Quoted and approved in Trimble v. Reid, 97 Ky. 713 (1895); asf&#x0027;d, 41 S. WV. Rep. 319 (1897), where a vendee sued the president for publishing a false statement as to the condition of a bank. 2 n the important case of Derry v. Peek, L R. 14 App. Cas 337 (1889), the House of Lords decided that in order to sustain an action of deceit there must be proof of fraud, and nothing short of that will suffice. Fraud is proved when it is shown that a false statement has been made (1) know-
			Ingly; (2) without belief in its truth; (3) recklessly. But if a man make a false statement honestly believing it to bo true it Is not suffcient, to support an action of deceit, to show that he had no reasolnable grounds for his belief. The directors of a tramway company issued a prospectus in which they stated that they were authorized to use steam power, and tbat by this imeans a great saving in working would be as- sected. The special act incorporating the company conferred this authority subject to the consent of the board of trade, but at the time of making the statement they had not in fact ob- tained consent to use steam power, al- though they honestly believed &#x0027;that they would obtain it as a matter of course. leld (reversing the judgment of the court below), that they were not liable in an action of deceit brought by a shareholder who lhad been induced to apply for shares by the statement in the prospectus. In an action for de- ceit by a misrepresentation in a pros- pectus as to the net profit on the capi- tal employed, the action being against one who was a promoter and also one of the vendors, and whose name ap- peared in the prospectus and who be- came a director, the plaintitf must prove (1) that the defendant&#x0027;s state- nent was untrue; (2) that it was dis- honest; (3) that he believed it to be un- true. See also Glasier v. Rolls, L R 42 Ch. D. 436 (1889), following the House of Lords in Derry v. Peek, L. I1 14 App. Cas. 337. In Peek t. Gurney, L R. 6 H. L. 77, 391 (1873), the court said: "It is said that the prospectus is true as far as it goes, but half a truth will some- times amount to a real falsehood." See also ch. IX, § 148, supra. In Bellairs t. Tucker, L R. 13 Q. B. D. 502, 579 (1884), 04

			Ill New York tile rule is more stringent. Tile case of Wakoman v. Dalley applies to this class of cases the rule that "an action founded upon the deocit and fraud of the defendant cannot be maintained in the absence of proof that he believed, or had reason to believe, at the timle lie made themo, that the representations made by hiin were false, and that they were for that reason fraud- ulently made, or that he assumed or intended to convey tlhe im- pression that lie had actual knowledge of their truth, though con- scious that lie had no such knowledge." This case held that a di- rector is not liable for false representations on the company&#x0027;s printed business cards, of which he was ignorant, oven though his namie was attached thereto. The same rule has been applied in other jurisdictions.2 In New York a vendee of stock and bonds however, the court said: "Tho action is one for deceit. It is necessary. . . not only to prove that the statements in a prospectus or any other document are not true, but it must be proved that they are fraudulently put forward with intent to deceive." 151 N. Y. 27, 85 (1872); Nelson v. Lu- ling. 36 N. Y. Super. Ct. 544 (1873); asf&#x0027;d, 62 N. Y. 045; Schwenck v. Naylor, 102 N. Y. 083 (1880). The case of Holmes v. Mortat, 120 N. Y. 150 (1890), was an ac- tion for false representations and deceit in the sale of stock, but the decision turned upon technical rules relative to the trial. The action for deceit does not lie against the corporation, at least where no fraudulent intent is proved. Pinedo v. Germania, etc. Co., . Y. D. Reg., July 29, 1885 (Supreme Ct.). See also g 157, supra. &#x0027;&#x0027;n an action of tort for deceit against a director for inducing a person to purchase stock, "the plaintiff must prove representations of material facts which are false, and which induce him to act; and either that the defendant knew them to be false, or that, the facts being facts susceptible of knowl- edge hlie represented as of his own knowledge that they were true, when in fact lie had no such knowledge." Cole v. Cassidy, 138 Mass. 487 (1885). In an action for fraud inducing the pur- chase of stock scienter must be proved.
			It is sufficient tlhit the defendant has no good reason to believe that material representations made by him were true. A statement that $1,500,000 worth of ore was lying on the ground around the mine is a material representation. Barndt v. Frederick, 78 Wis. 1 (1890). In Wisconsin, in a suit by a vendee of stock against the vendor for damages for obtaining money and property by false and fraudulent representations, the defendant may be arrested. War- ner r. Bates. 75 Wis. 278 (1889), giving the complaint and affidavit. See also Clark v. Edgar, 84 Mo. 106 (1884); Gee v. Moss, 08 Iowa, 318 (1886). An allegation that the plaintiff was induced by the false and fraudulent misrepresentations of the defendant to buy from the latter certain stock which was valueless, and that the defendant knew that the statements were untrue. and that the plaintiff relied on the statements and bought the stock, con- stitutes a cause of action in tort. Free- man v. Trickett, 0 Kan. App. 83 (1897. A person who makes false statements in regard to a corporation, and then ad- vises the party to whom the statements are made to buy the stock, is liable, in an action for deceit to such party. Heintz v. Mueller, 19 Ind. App. 240 i1898); Arkwright v. Newbold, L. R. 17 Ch. D. 801 (1881); Arthur v. Griswold, 55 N. Y. 400, 410 (1874), the court say-

			who sues at law to recover damages for fraud and dlceit induc- ing the purchase of the stock, the fraud and ldceit consisting of a misstatement by an ollicer of the liabilities of the company, must prove that tle olllcer did not believe tle statement to be a true ex- hibit of the company&#x0027;s affairs and was guilty of dishonesty. It is insullicient to prove that the statement was grossly inaccurate, and largely understated the actual liabilities of the company. Actual fraud must be proved. It must be shown that the representation was not only falso and material, but was known by the defendant when lie Inade it to be false, or, not knowing whether it was true or false, and not caring what the fact might be, that thle defendant mande it recklessly, paying no heed to the injury which miight ensue. " Misjudgmnent however gross, or want of caution however marked, is not fraud. Intentional fraud, as distinguished from a mere breach of duty or the omission to use duo care, is an essential factor in an action for deceit." When a stockholder receives an offer for his stock, and is persuaded not to sell by fraudulent representations of a director, he may hold the latter liable in damages. So also where the principal gives an order to the broker to sell certain stock, which the principal owns, and the broker, by fraudulent representations, dissuades him from selling, the principal may hold the broker liable ing: "The rules of law require a rea- sonable degree of certainty as to each requisite necessary to constitute the cause of action, viz., representations. falsity, scienter, deception, and injury." In a sale of stock by a director, a misstatement made by him in good faith, as to the property owned by the corporation, does not render him liable in an action for deceit. Boddy . Henry, 113 Iowa. 462 (1001). To sustain an ac- tion for deceit it must be proved that the representation was false and that the party making it knew it to be false, but if such party had means of knowl- edge, but actually had no knowledge, this is suflicient to hold him liable. Hindman v. First Nat. Bank, 112 Fed. Rep. 931 (1002). A bank, which, as pledgee, causes by its statements a party to purchase the stock held in pledge, may be held liable in damages if such statements were false. Ilindman v. First Nat. Bank, etc., 98 Fed. Rep. 562 (1809). Where a purchaser of goods misrepresents the value of stock which
			is to be given as a pledge for the pur. chase price and refers the vendor to a bank, which bank repeats the misrep- resentations, the pledgee may sue the bank for damages and may show that the bank at that time held such stock in pledge and that the goods so pur. chased were substituted for the stock of the bank upon the transaction being closed., Am. Nat. Bank, etc. v. Ham- mond, 25 Colo. 367 (1898). In an action for deceit it is not necessary to allege that the plaintiffs would not have pur- chased but for the false representa- tions Drake v. Holbrook, 66 S. WV. Rep. 512 (Ky. 1002) In a suit by a subscriber against persons inducing him to sub- scribe by fraudulent misrepresenta- tions, the corporation is not a necessary party defendant.

			The purchaser of stock who has given a note in payment cannot defeat an action on the note by setting up that the purchase was induced by fraud. lie must first disallirm the contract and return the certificate, and such return must be made before the trial.4 But where tho purchaser brings an action for deceit he need not return the consideration nor rescind the contract.8 His injury is to be duly measured, and credit may be given for the real value of the stock.&#x0027; A director is not liable for the misrepresentations and frauds of his co-directors, unless he has expressly authorized or tacitly permitted commission thereof.7 The mere fact of being a director "is not per se sufficient to hold a party liable for the frauds and misrepresentations of the active managers of a corpora- tion. Some knowledge of and participation in the act claimed to be fraudulent must be brought home to the person charged.&#x0027;a Where, however, proof is given tending to show that the defend- ants were jointly engaged in a common scheme to defraud the plaintiff, the acts and declarations of one are admissible in proof against all;9 and frauds of a similar nature, at or near the same time as the one complained of, may be shown.&#x0027;0 The fraud prac- ticed need not have been the sole inducement to the purchase."

Each must sue separately.6 In a suit for damages for fraud inducing the sale of stock the court will be liberal in admitting evidence showing the full nature of the transaction, and it is for the jury to decide whether the fraud was intentional and whether there was any fraud.7 The measure of damages for fraud inducing the purchase of stock "is the differ- ence between the value of the stock at the time it was purchased and the price paid for it."8 An agreement by which a suit for that he relied solely upon the misrepre- sentations.

Where a person is induced to subscribe for stook on the fraudulent ropreseutationls of tle piresident that the comlpany is in a pros- purous condition, the person ... y file a bill in equity to recover back the money, and equity has jurisdiction on the grounds of discovery, account, fraud, misrepresentation, and conoeaulment. Both the company and the president individually were maide defendants and held liable. Tyler v. Savage, 148 U. . 70 (1892). See also Hill v. Lane, L R. 11 Eq. 215 (1870), where the court said: "It is so well settled that this court will entertain jurisdiction in such cases that it would be a misfortune indeed to the public if there were any sufficient ground for considering that the juris- diction is doubtful. . . Although courts of common law may have juris- diction in some such cases, there is clearly concurrent jurisdiction in this court," doubting Ogilvie v. Currie, 87 L J. (Ch.) 541 (1868); Campbell v. Fleming. 1 Ad. &#x0026; El. 40 (1834). A bill in equity is a proper remedy for fraud inducing a sale of stock. Andriessen&#x0027;s Appeal, 123 Pa. St. 303 (1889). A bill in equity does not lie at the instance of a purchaser of stock, who has paid for the stock, to rescind on the ground that le was defrauded. The remedy is at law. Moreover, such a bill is multifari- ous if it asks also for a discovery. Price v. Hurley, 51 Atl. Rep. 339 (Pa. 1002). Where a corporation organized to do a jewelry business is really a scheme to carry on an illegal and fraudulent in- vestment business, a person defrauded may file a bill in equity to hold the corporation and its officers and stock- holders personally liable and enjoin
			them from disposing of the assets and for discovery. Edwards v. Michigan, etc. Co., 92 N. W. Rel). 491 (Mlich. 9102). Where the president of a national bank induces a person who lives several hundred miles away from the bank to purchase stock in the bank by fraudu- lent representations, and within thirty- six days the bank is closed, the pur- chaser may have the sale rescinded. Stulllebenin v. De L4lshmutt, 101 Fed. Rep. 307 (1900). Where the president sells stock for $120 per share after lie has indorsed a false statement of the company&#x0027;s affairs, the stock being really worth but $70 per share, the vendee may have the sale rescinded. Prewitt v. Tril)le, 02 Ky. 170 (1891). In a suit to rescind for fraud the plaintiff must prove that the stock was not worth what lie paid for it or could not be sold for that sum. Aron v. De Castro, 13 N. Y. Supp. 373 (1801); affirmed, 131 N. Y. 648. In an action in equity to rescind a sale of stock for fraud the corporation is not a necessary party. The value of the stock need not be shown, and the amount paid with interest may be re- covered. But six years&#x0027; delay after discovering the fraud is a bar. Higgins v. Crouse, 63 Hun, 134(1892). In an ac- tion to rescind for fraud the defrauded subscribers need not join as plaintiffs, although they all purchased at the same time and on the same terms. Mloore v. Robertson, 11 N. Y.

Innocent acts or misrepresentations the vendees may rescind as to the vendors, but cannot matke the receiver of the companly pay over the money. Moore v. Robertson, 11 N. Y. Supp. 798 (1800).

Fernley, 9 Sim. 550 (1839), where a sale by n di- rector who has issued false reports and declared illegal dividends was set aside. The corporation is a proper party to such actions, if a registry has been ob- tained by the person who has obtained the stock by fraud, since a retransfer on the corporate books is asked for. See also Bradley v. Luce, 99 111. 234 (1881). A judgment creditor of a foreign cor- poration cannot enjoin it from trans- ferring stock and bonds owned by it. The remedy sought must be some- thing in addition to the injunction. Rogers v. Michigan, etc. R. I., 28 Barb. 539 (1858). An equitable suit does not lie to rescind a sale of worthless bonds. A suit at law is the proper remedy. U. S. Bank v. Lyon County. 48 Fed. Rep. 632 (1892). A purchaser of stock wiho was induced to purchase by fraud can- not maintain a suit in equity when he fails to show moro than a right to pe- cuniary dama;ges for misrepresenta- tions. Whitney v. Fairbanks, 54 Fed. Rep. 98. (1893). A contract between tle owner of property and a promoter by which the former agrees to sell his prolprty to a corporation to be formed by the latter, with a specilied capital stock, cannot, a year after the transac-
			tlon has been carried out, bo made tle basis of a suit in equity to compel the promoter to cancol excessive stock which was issued to the promoter, thoro being no allegation that the promoter still had the stock. The remedy of the vendor is at law. Even though several vendors to the corporation had a slmi. lar claim, yet one of them cannot file such a bill in equity in behalf of him- self and others. Brelim v. Sperry, 92 Md. 878 (1901). Where both the pur- chaser and seller of stock in a mining company know at the time that there is a report that the mine has been "salted," tlhe sale cannot be rescinded, inasmuch as neither party has clean hands. Bearden v. Jones, 48 S. W. Rep. 88 (Tenn. 1897). A creditor holding an unpaid promissory note cannot by bill in equity bring in the directors to hold them liable for false representations and also claim that the company was not duly incorporated; and further bring in a subsequent corporation that took all tile a-sets of the first, and also bring in those persons who finally ob. tained such assets,-all in one bill brought to collect the debt. Jefferson Nat. Bank v. Texas Inv. Co., 74 Tex. 421 (1889). See to the effect that a court of equity has jurisdiction, City, etc. Corp. v. Central Trust Co. (N. Y. L. J., Jure 12, 1891). Where bank stock is sold by fraudulent and false representations, the bank being aware thereof and re- ceiving indirectly tle money paid for the stock, the sale may be rescinded and the money recovered back from it, even though it is insolvent. Florida, etc. Co. v. Merrill, 52 Fed. Rep. 77(1892).

A promoter who has taken a contract to purchase a property at a certain price, based upon reports and representations that the business&#x0027;had not decreased since the reports, may, upon discover- ing that the business has largely de. creased, refuse to carry out the con- tract, and may hold the party liable for his disbursements, but not for profits which lie would have made if his plans had been carried out.

			Although the buyer of stock purchased it at a small nominal price by reason of fraudulent misrepresentations, yet the seller can- not maintain a bill in equity to rescind, where the stock las no special value other than its money value, and the latter can readily be sllown.3 Tlhe fraud may be waived by the acts of the vendee.&#x0027; The right to rescind the contract for fraud is waived by taking a bond of indemnity against liability on the stook, such bond being taken upon discovery of the fraud.l A party cannot rescind a pur- chase of stock on the ground of false representations as to tboe com- pany&#x0027;s having a secret process, where he learned about the process before completing his purchase, and had held the stock a year, and endeavored to sell the process." A person cannot rescind for fraud a purchase of stock from the corporation itself, where, subsequently to discovering the fraud, he attended a stockholders&#x0027; meeting, and voted to assess tile stock, and afterwards attended another stock- holders&#x0027; meeting and paid the assessment.&#x0027;

A stock- holder cannot maintain such a suit in behalf of himself or other stockholders, even though he was induced to pur- chase his stock by reason of such divi- (lends. In this case the court carefully reviewed many precedents. Siegman v. Maloney, 51 Atl. Rep. 1003 (N. J. 1902). I Carr v. Nat. Bank, etc. Co., 167 N. Y. 875 (1901). If rescission is sought not on the ground of mistake, but of fraud- ulent representations, it must be shown that such representations were made with knowledge of their falsity and with intent to deceive, and that they had that effect; in other words, scienter must be proved.

A person may defeat notes given for stock which he was induced fraudulently to purchase from the corporation, even though he became and remained cash- ier for the corporation for over a year after the sale and before he set up the defense, and was a director and voted the stock. He did not necessarily learn the facts from occupying these posi- tions, nor from the fact that le made official reports of the condition of the * company. He was not bound to inves-

Although lie does not discover the fraud for four years lie may then rescind. Mlayo v. Knowlton, 134 N. Y. 50 (1892). A suit to cancel a sale of stocks and bonds,on the ground of fraud on the part of the purchaser, will not lie where the money paid at the sale las not been returned or tendered, even though the seller spent the money before lie dis- covered tile alleged fraud, and is unable to obtain the amount of money neces- sary for a tender.

Gas- sett v. Ghlziei, 105 Mapss. 473 (1800). In rescinding for fraud the vendee of stock must return or tender the dividends balck to the vendor, but cannot demand repayment of assessments paid after discovery of the fraud. Marten v. Paul, etc. Co., 99 Cal. 355 (1803) Where a party has given a note in purchase of stock in two corporations. he cannot rescind unless he tenders back the stock in both. Rohrballer .: Kleebauer, 110 Cal. 200 (1897). Where, according to contract, stock sold to the corporation is appraised by the corporation and the appraised price is actually paid to and received by the stockholder, he cannot maintain a bill to obtain a larger price, but must either rescind or sue at law. Tuttle v. Batchelder, etc. Co., 170 Mass. 315 (1808). 1 Chisholm v. Eisenhuth, 09 N.Y. App. Div. 134 (1902), holding also that even though the misrepresentations were made by the husband in selling the wife&#x0027;s stock, yet this is sufficient. Re- scission can only be had where an offer to return the property has been made and kept good and the offer is repeated on the trial. Currier v. Poor, 84 Hun, 45 (1895). See also § 335, supra. 2 Long a: Johnson, 15 Lid. App. 499 (1890). Where the vendee has disposed of some of the stock before he discov- ered the fraud, he need not tender back
			all the stock, but he must allege that he sold it before ho discovered the fraud, and set forth the price and other facts. IIill v. Hlarriman, 05 Tenn. 800(1895). A misrepresentation that large dividends and profits are being made by a coal company, whereas in fact they were made by fraud practiced upon a rail- road company, is good ground for a re- scission of the sale. No tender back of the stock need be made, if the property · is worthless. If there was a partial failure of consideration, the defendant could reduce tlhe recovery prn tanto. A court of equity may set aside the sale on grounds which would not be suffi- cient at law. The court so held in an action at law for the purchase price, the answer setting up fraud as a de- sense. Boggs v. Wann, 58 lSed. Rep. 081 (1803). Where a corporation iells its property through misrepresentations, and in deeding the property causes all its outstanding capital stock to be de- livered to the vendee, the vendee in suing to recover back the money need not allege that the stock was valueless, there being an allegation that the prop- erty was valueless. Keener v. Baker, 93 Fed. Rep. 877 (1899). 3 Hanrahan v. National, etc. Assoc., 48 Atl. Rep 517 (N. J. 1901). 4 Bradley v. Bradley, 105 N.

Stolen or lost certificates of stock indorsed in b7ankr.- One of the most important elements of the negotiability of promissory notes is that, if the holder of such note loses it or it is stolen from hilm when it is indorsed in blank, a subsequent bonafide purchaser of such note is protected as against the person who lost it. A dif- ferent rule seems to prevail as regards certificates of stock indorsed in blank and then lost or stolen. In this respect certificates of stock are not negotiable. It has been clearly held that a purchaser from a thief of certificates of stock indorsed in blank is not pro- tected, nor is any subsequent purchaser of that identical ccrt,&#x0027;jictls allowed to claim the stock, unless the owner has been guilty of negligence. The real owner of the certificate may conmpel the cor- poration, which has refused to recognize the thief&#x0027;s transferee&#x0027;s title, to register the stock as his, or lie may have dalmages against a bonafide transferee of the thief where such transferee has sold

Tle bona Jide purchaser of a certificate of stock indorsed in blank, but which was stolen from the owner, is not protected. East Birmingham Land Co. v. Dennis, 85 Ala. 565 (1888). A stock broker is liable to the owner for the value of mining shares received for sale from one who had stolen them, although lie acted in good faith, without notice, and paid the proceeds to the thief, relying on his representations of ownership. Swim r. Wilson, 90 CaL 126 (1891). Cf. 452, infra. In Knox v. Eden Musie. etc. Co., 148 N. Y. 441, 456 (1896), the court said that there was "no case en- titled to be regarded as authority which denies to the owner of a stock certilicate which has been lost without his negligence. or stolen, the right to reclaim it from the hands of any person
			in wlose possession it subsequently comes, although the holder may have taken it in good faith and for value."
			. . Thi title of the true owner of a lost or stolen certificate may be as- serted against any one subsequently obtaining its possession, although the holder may be a bona Jide purchaser." Even though a stockholder loses two certilicates of stock and another person finds two of the same amount, never- theless it is for a jury to decide whether it is the same stock. McFadden v. Goet- tert. 131 Cal. 333 (1901). In a suit against a corporation for refusing to transfer stock, the fact that the certificates had been lost since the refusal need not be alleged. Blair Co. v.

			Where certificates of stock indorsed in blank have been stolen, and the thief or his transferco ihas obtained a registry on the cor- porate hooks and obtained new certificates of stock, and tlese new certificates have been sold, the purchaser is protected in his posses- sion of the stoclk. In MAichigan this is held to be the rule, even tlough such piurchaser took the stock with full knowledge of all the facts.7 This decision may have gone too far, but it is in ac- was sought to extend this doctrine to the sale of certillcates of stock whiclh had only been misapplied. Here de- fendant, a broker. had innocently sold for a fraudulent principal indorsed cer- tificates of stc.. ,, which had not been stolen from the owner, but had been delivered by him to defendant&#x0027;s fraud- ulent principal, who had sold the cer- tificates to defendaht through another innocent broker. The New York court held the broker in this case to stand on the same footing as an innocent pur- chaser and not liable to the owner for the proceeds; but no opinion was ex- pressed as to the rule of liability if the stock had been stolen instead of mis- applied. 1 Sherwood v. Meadow Valley lin. Co.. 50 Cal. 412 (1875). Although two persons have a safety-deposit box ; commnon, and one of themi stenil: there- from a certificate of stock owned by the other and indorsed in blank by the latter, yet a puirclaser even in good faith of such stolen certili(ate is not protected.

			§ 359. Owner of a lost cortiflcat1 of stoolk may obtain a now cor- tiJicate.- An owner of a certillcato of stock who has lost it or had it stolen from him may, by taking proper proceedings or by giving proper security to the corporation, have now certificates issued to hlil. In Louisiana it is held that, upon satisfactory proof of the loss of certificates of stock, a writ of mandamtus will issue to con- pel tie corporation to issue new certificates, and that no bond of in- Idemnity need he given.&#x0027; But the better rule is that, except in cases of the clearest proof of loss, the corporation 1hall not be re- quired to issue new certificates unless a bond of indemnity ngainst its liability to possible legal holders of the lost certificate bo given.2 In New York, by statute, security may be required in all such cases.3 A stockholder may file a &#x0027;bill in equity to compel the cor- poration to issue to him a new certificate of stock in place of one l State r. New Orleans Gas Light Co., 25 La. Ann. 413 (1873). Where sixteen years have elapsed since a stockholder lost his certificate of stock and gave notice to that effect to the corporation, the court may grant mandamus for the issue of a new certificate in lieu there- of without security being given. State v. New Orleans, etc R. R, 51 iLa Ann. 900 (1899). 2 Galveston City Co. v. Sibley, 56 Tex. 269 (1882), where one who became a stockholder in 1841 died in 1865, and his heirs applied for a new certilicate in 1878. Societe G6nerale v. Walker, L R. 11 App. Cas. (H.

A corporation need not issue new certificates of stock in place of those which are lost unless a bond of indemnity be given. Guilford v. West- ern U. Tel. Co., 43 Minn. 434 (1800). No bond of indemnity will be required where twelve years have elapsed since the certificate of stock was lost. A citizen of Minnesota may sue in its courts to compel a foreign corporation to issue a new certificateif proper serv-

Co., l5 Minn. 832 (1894). Where a person buys stock at a bankrupt sale, but does not get the certificates, and ten years elapse, such purchaser is en- titled to a mandainus requiring the corporation to issue new certificates to him.

WVhere an application is made under ile Nevw &#x0027;Yoi! statute for a new certificate, in place of one that has been lost or de- stroyed. and there is no direct proof of the destruction, the court should re- quire publication of the notice of the proceeding. and where the value of the stock is $20.000, although the par value is but $5,000, a bond in the sum of $25,000 is reasonable. Matter of Speir, 69 N. Y. App. Div. 140 (1902). Before proceedings under the New York stat- ute to obtain a new certificate for a lost certificate of stock may be insti- tuted, a demand on the corporation must be made.

			that is lost, oven though the statute gives an additional relnedy.1 It would seein reasonable that a bond of indemnnity should be given to the corporation, since, in ease the old certilicato has not been lost, but has been sold by its owner, the corporation is liablo in dlalages to the purchaser for issuing new certillcates without a surrendler of the old.&#x0027;2 Where certificates of stock have been lost, anl a party turns up with them and applies for transfer on the corporate books, the real owner may enjoin a transfer of the cer- ti fcate, and also any transfer by the corporation on its books, pen- dento lite.&#x0027; In North Carolina there is a statute to the effect that an indemnity bond must be given in order to obtain a now certifi- cate for one that has been lost, and the company&#x0027;s treasurer is en- titled to retain the new certificate for live years.4
			§ 360. Rights of a puIrchlaser of a certiJicate of stock wihere the corloration has registered a transfer to another without a surrender of the cerCtificate.- It sometimes happens that an owner of stock, after selling his stock and delivering to the vendee the certificate therefor indorsed in blank, has gone to the corporation before such transfer is registered, and by misrepresentation or other fraudulent means induced the corporation to issue to another purchaser a new certificate of stock without a surrender of the old one. It is the publication of the application and also the giving of notice to the stockholder of record. Matter of Coats, 75 N. Y. App. Div. 469 (1902). This statute does not give a remedy to a purchaser of stock at a receiver&#x0027;s sale. If he is una- ble to obtain the outstanding certifi- cates his remedy is different. Re Big- lin v.

			duty of the corporation to refuse to register a transfer unless tile old certificate is delivered up. The outstanding cortillcate is a con- tinuing afiurmatlon by thl corporation that no registry of a transfer of the stock represented by that certificate will be allowed until the certificate itself is presentcd and surrendered. This aillrmation is soneitiimes declared in a byh-law,&#x0027; and sometimes it is printed on the face of the certilicato itself.&#x0027; The obligation of the corporation, however, to require a surrender of the old certificato upon obtain- ing a registry is tile same whether there is a by-law or a statement on the certificate, or neither of these*. It exists without any ex- press declaration.3 Where stock is transferred without a transfer of the certificate, and the transferrer afterwards transfers the ccr- tiiicato to another party, the former is liable to the first transferee.4 So also if the vendor afterwards oltains the certificates and sells them again to others, he is liable to the first person to whom he sold his interest.&#x0027; Where the treasurer of a corporation is in debt to it and pledges his stock as security therefor, and the president puts it away, and afterwards the president buys the stock from the treasurer, but the certificate cannot be found, and a new certificate is issued for it and delivered to tile president, and two years there- after the trcasui 3r linds the old certificate of stock and pledges it, the president is protected in his purchase, there having been no culpable negligence on his part."

			§ 302. 1?ilhts of ptnrchascr of stock without certificates.-- A pur- chaser of stock who does not receiv, the cortilicates of the stock he has purchased, but who nevertheless obtains a registry on the corporate books, and receives now certilicates without a surrender of thl old, and who sells tho new certificates, is not liable in dam- ages to the holder of the old certifica;tes,3 unless ho obtained registry with knowledge that his vendor had already sold the old certificates to another.4 The renledy of the latter is against the corporation, or he may sue the corporate oincer who allowed the transfer.8 The purchaser of the stock may insist on the old certillcate being pro- duced and surrendered at the time of registration, but if he waives this right, and a registry is made, he cannot afterwards refuse to :accept the stock on that account." The corporation is not liable to purchaser, to whom the certificates are tranoferred, and a third party, to whom the vendor had given the stock previous to the sale, the vendee with the certifi- cates is protected. Crawford v. Dox, 5 Hun, 507 (1875). In Wilson v. Atlantic, etc. R. R., 2 Fed. Rep. 459 (1880), where an assignee in bankruptcy applied for registry, the bankrupt having fled with the certificates, it was held that the corporation was bound to allow trins- ser and to issue new certificates upon a bond of indennity being given. However, a sale of a certificate of stock to a bonafide purchaser is to be upheld, even as against a receiver who has been appointed and been given legal ownership of the stock. Dudley v.

Y. 441 (1890), certificates of stock had been delivered to the corporation for transfer and the new certificates had been duly issued. The old certificates were put in a safe uncanceled, and were illegally abstracted by an em- ployee and sold. The court held that the company was not liable on such certificates to a person who took them in p!edge from such employee. The court, however, based its decision, not on the fact that the pledgee took with notice, but on the principle of law that no one could acquire title tostolen cer- tificates of stock. A transferee who re- ceives new certificates of stock is no&#x0027; affected by the fact that tl&#x0027;h old certifi- cates are fraudulently re-issued by a corporate officer.

Sinn v. Brown, 142 U. S. 56 (1891).

Birmingham Axle Co, 41 Conn. 255 (1874), the corporation was protected by its lien, and the fact that it bought the stock without the cer- tificates was not the essential point of the case.

			places at the same time. For tile purposes of suits concerning rights to its title, for taxation, and for a sow other purposes, shares of stock follow thle domicile of tlh stockholder.&#x0027; On the other hand, it has at tile same time a situs where the corporation exists, and this sitt8 may be for tlh purposes of suits concerning the title to the stock, for attachment and execution, and for various other similar purposes. Groat difliculty arises in many instances of legal proceedings affecting the title to stock, by reason of the fact that, where the defendent has in his possession the certilicates of stock, and is not onj(,inbd from transferring them, lhe may transfer them, either before or after suit has been commenced against him to oltain possession of the stock represented by such certificates, or to subject it to his debts. The question then arises whether the Lonuta Jile transferee of such ceertificate is to be allowed to re- tain the stock, or whether the successful plaintiff in the suit ngainst the defendant who has transferred the stock may follow such stock and take it from the transferee. This conllic. of right between the purchaser of the outstanding certificates and the purchaser whose title is based on judicial proceedings arises most often in cases of attachment or execution issued against shares of stock at the domicile of the corporation. In such cases the better rule seems to be that transferees of the certificate held by the defendant are protected and entitled to protection at the hands of the corporation, if their purchase was made before the attachment or execution was levied; but that transfers made after the levy are not binding so far as the corporation and the plaint- iffs to the suit are concerned, provided the suit itself is success- ful.3 The same difficulty and conflict of rights arise in suits to reclaim stock which has been taken from the plaintiff by fraud, or by the torts of an agent or pledgee, or by the breach of trust of an executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee.3 The plaintiff seek- ing to recover his stock, certificates for which are in the hands of the defendant, seems to have but two modes of procedure whereby he may prevent the defendant from transferring the certificates. I It is important here to distinguish duties of the corporatior herein when shares of stock from the certificates stock is sold under an execution or is for those shares. The stock itself is not attached, see § 489, infra. the same as the certificate representing 2 Smith v. American Coal Co., 7 Lans. it. Winslow v. Fletcher, 53 Conn. 390 317 (1878); Smith v.

It is for the pledgee to intervene and prove that the pledge was bonafide.&#x0027; It is true tlat, after judgment has been obtained and the decree of the court executed, any subsequent transfer of the certificates by the defendant is null and may be disregarded by the plaintiff and by the corporation." But while the suit is pending the defendant may transfer the certificates, and&#x0027; the bona Jide transferee takes a good title to the stock. The latter is not affected by or bound to take notice of a lispendens in that suit. If no temporary injunc- tion is obtained, a transfer made on the corporate books pending suit is good, and the corporation cannot be made liable, although a party defendant.6 W&#x0027;here the real owner of stock brings suit against a transferee of that stock who has obtained a new certificate there- for and succeeds in the suit, and in the meantime the defendant has assigned the stock to a third party, the corporation may institute 1 Quarl v.

But if such stocks are in pledge, and tile pledger does not pay the loan while the stocks aro so tied up, no damages can be recovered.? Under the statutes of California, even though stock is distributed by executors in accordl- ance with a decree of distribution, and the distributees sell the stock, and it is transferred on the books of the company, novertheless if the decree is reversed on appeal, the transfers are void and the conmpany is liable for dividends paid in the meantime to such pur- chasers. In a suit by tile executors to recover such dividends the purchasers need not be made parties.3
			§ 301i. Lis penlens u as aflcti a prch of stocso.-A purchaser of certificates of stock is not chargeable witll constructive notice that a suit is pending in which his vendor is defendant, and that the plaintiff is endeavoring to obtain possession and title to the stock which the purchaser is buying. The doctrine of lis penduns has no application to sales of shares of stock. The purchaser is bound to know that a judgment or decree has been rendered anti executed affecting the certificates he is buying, if such a judgment or decree exists; but he is not bound to know that a suit is pending in which judgment has not yet been rendered. That a lis pedelns in a suit involving shares of stock does not affect a purchaser of the certificate representing those shares, the purchase being made while the suit is pending, was clearly established by the court of appeals of New York in the case of Ilolbrook v.

The forgery itself may consist of any writing on the cer- tificate of stock, whereby, with intent to defraud, it is falsely and materially so madel or alterel as to have an apparent legality.&#x0027; Generally the forgery is of the name of the stockholder to the transfer on the back of the certificate.` The forgery may, however, be committed by changing tile number of shares of stock which the transferror has written out in the transfer,3 or by inserting the numbers of shares of stock of one corporation in a blank transfer duly signed by tile stockholder, but signed for the purpose of trans- ferring shares of stock in another and different corporation.4
			The subject of forgery by one or more corporate oflicers, whereby spurious and overissued stock is issued, there being no old certifi cates returned to the company at that time, is considered else where.5
			The subject now under consideration is where the name of a stock- holder is forged to an assign mnent of the certificate, or the certificate itself is modified.
			§ 360. liigqts and liabilities of transferee s of.foryed certificates of stoci, there being no intervenin! reffistry on corporate books.--The position of a transferee of a certificate of stock which is invalid by reason of forgery depends largely on whether there has been an intervening registry of transfer on the corporate books after the &#x0027;See 1 Bouvier&#x0027;s L. Diet., p. 679; 2 Bish. Cr. L., § 523. 2 Nearly all of the cases in the several following sections are cases of a forgery of the stockholder&#x0027;s name to a tranrfer. It is forgery for one trustee to write in the names oftheotller trustees without authority. Cottant v. Eastern Counties Ry., 1 J. &#x0026; H. 243 (1860): Sloman t: Bank of England. 14 Sim. 475 (1845).

			former owner was deprived of his stock by til forgery. Tile forger himself is of course liable, not only to the real stockholder, but also to any other person who has been injured by the forgery. If the purchaser of stock from one who has forged a transfer of the same sells the saino after being notified by the real owner that the latter claims tile stock and has been deprived of it ly forgery, the real owner may recover damnages in trover for the value of the stock from tile person who so sells, although the latter purchased in good faith and without notice of the forgery.l Where an agent of a stockholder forges his name to the certificates of stool and pledges them with a party to secure a loan to the agent&#x0027;s principal, such loan cannot be collected, even though the proceeds went to the credit of the principal and were afterwards embezzled by the agent under a power of attorney to check out the principal&#x0027;s money, the party loaning the money on the certificates of stock not having any knowledge of such power of attorney at the time.2 If the forgery is committed by a member of a firm, the real owner may sue the firm for money had and received, and may recover the value of the stock and dividends.3 Where the forger has sold tle stock to a purchaser without notice, and the latter has sold to another pur- chaser without notice, and the latter is deprived of his apparent ownership on account of the forgery, the second transferee may hold the first transferee liable.&#x0027; This principle grows out of the well- established rule of law that, in a sale of chattels, there is an implied warranty of title, unless the circumstances are such as to give rise to a contraryv presumption. A person who signs as a witness a forged transfer of stock is personally liable, even though he did so without knowledge of the fraud.2 The broker and auctioneer of stock which passes through their hands cannot, it seems, be held liable, though it turns out that on account of a forgery there was I Monk v. Grahaln, 8 Blod. 9 (1721). Fay v. Slaughter, 194 Il. 157(1901). 3 Marsll v. Keating. 1 Bing. N. Cas. 198 (18s34; Stone v. Marsh, 0 B. &#x0026; C. 551 (1827). 4 Matthews v. Massachusetts Nat. Bank, Holmes, 390 (1874); s c., 10 Fed. Cas 1113. This was an extremely harsh case, involving a rigid applica- tion of the principle, since the defend- ant&#x0027;s name appeared on the back of the certificate of stock as a transferrer when in fact it had only been a pledgee, and on payment of the pledge had retransferred the stock. As to the lia- bility of brokers for the forgery of
			their employee in delivering spurious stock to a customer, see Andrews v. Clark, 72 Md. 390 (1890). See §452, infra. Compare, however, §§ 290 and 858, notes, supra. A purchaser without notice of a forged bond may recover back the price paid by him to the vendor, even though the vendor was himself a bonafide pur- chaser and without notice of the ille- gality of the bond. Thereis an implied warranty of identity of the thing sold. Meyer v. Richards, 168 U. S 885 (1890). See also § 704, infra. 5 Second Nat. Bank v. Curtisa, 2 N. Y.

If the corporation has already registered hlin as transferee, it may repudiate its registry so far as ho is concerned, and refuse to recognize him as a stockholder or as having the right to transfer the stock.2 Such a registered transferee has no right of action against the corporation by reason of its re scission of his registry,&#x0027; although the rule may be dileorentif lie pur- chased by reason of the fact that he was allowed such registry on the corporate books.4 The person who first obtains a registry after a forgery has deprived the real owner of his stock cannot retain the new certilicates as against the real owner of the old ones._ A transferee of stock, the transfer of which has been forged, is liable to the corporation upon the corporation being held liable, oven though such transferee acted in good faith.0 l Machinists&#x0027; Nat.

For a careful analysis of the English cases to the effect that the corporation is liable to a person who actually pays money or loses money in reliance upon the "certifi. tion" or act of the corpo- ration lirectl, with the purchaser of a certificate, even though there has been no intervening transfer, see 6 Judicial Review (Eng.), 58. See also Telegraph Co. v. Davenport, 97 U. 5. 309 (1878), where the court said: " Upon the facts stated there ought to be no question as to the right of the plaintiffs to have their shares replaced on tie books of the company and proper certificates issued to them, and to recover the divi- dends accrued on the shares after the unauthorized transfer; or to have al.
			ternativo judgments for the value of the shares and the dividends. Forgery can confer no power lnor transfer any righte. The officors of the company are the custodians of its stock-books, and it is their duty tosee that all trans- sers of shares hro plroperly made, either by the stockhlolders themselves or per. sons having authority from them. If upon the presentation of a certificate for transfer they are at lil doubtful of the identity of the party offering it with its owner, or if not satisfied of the genuineness of a power of attorney produced, they can require the identity of the party in the one case, and the genuineness of the document in the other, to be satisfactorily established before allowing the transfer to be made. In either case they must act upon their own responsibility. . . . Neitherthe absence of blame on the part of the officers of the company in allowing an unauthorized transfer of stock, nor the good faith of the purchaser of stolen property, will avail as an answer to the demand of the true owner." A corpo- ration is liable to the owner of stock if it allows a transfer of the stock to be made to a transferee who forged the owner&#x0027;s name to the transfer on the back of the certificate of stock.

			however, as a bolnafitd transferee of the illegally registered trans- forrer is entitled to retain the stock, tho former owner of tho stock, in suing the corporation, should demand relief in the alternativo, that tile stock be restored to him, or that he be given daliagcs in lieu thereof.&#x0027; Or lie may demand that tile corporation replace tile stock by going into tile market, if necessary, and purchasing similar stock.2 If tho stockholder sues the corporation for a divi- tlden on stock which by a forged assignment has been registered in tlh name of another person, the corporation cannot intorpload.l A court of equity has concurrent jurisdiction with law in remedy- ing a forged transfer of stock.4 The corporation, tho co-conspirators, and the transferees of the forged certilicate are all proper parties to tile suit;6 but tile only necessary party is the corporation itself." (n the other hand, it is tile transferee obtaining registry who war- rants the validity of his title and right to transfer; and if the corporation is compelled to pay damages to the real owner on ac- count of allowing such registry, it may have recourse to and collect the same ldanages from the transferee who obtained the registry, however innocent the latter may have been.&#x0027; Where stock stands in the name of two trustees, and one of them signs a transfer and pel the corporation to cancel the trans- ser and re-issue the stock to hinl, or else to pay hlim the value thereof. The court also held in this case that the fact that the stockholder gave a person access to the safe-deposit box containing such certificates of stock was no defense to the corporation. and also the fact that the stockholder had authorized such person to sign the stockholder&#x0027;s name to other certificates of stock was no defense to the corporation. Pennsyl- vania Co. v.Franklin Ins. Co., 181 Pa. St. 40 (1897). A corporation canceling a certificate of stock and issuing an- other certificate to the assignee under a forged assignment will be required to re-issue to the original owner a certifi- cate in lieu of the one canceled. The holder of the certificate which was illegally issued is not a necessary party to the suit unless it is shown that the plaintiff is Insolvent, or that there will be an overissue by the corporation if the certificate is issued to the plaintiff.

			g 3nGS, 309. The riglht of the rightful owner of the stock to com- plain of the forgery whereby his certificate has passed into the possession of another may be barred by estoppel or ratification. Formerly it was held that the negligence of the owner of the stock would be a bar to his remedy." Later decisions, however, have firmly established the rule that "there must be either something that amounts to an estoppel, or something that amounts to a ratili- cation, in order to make the negligence a good answer." 7 Accord- ingly, tie rightful owner of the stock is held not to be barred of lOliver v. Governor, etc., [1901] 1 Ci. 052: asf&#x0027;d, 80 L. T. Rep. 248 (1902). 2 Philadelphia Nat. Bank v. Smith, 195 Pa. St. 38 (1900). 3 American Tel. etc. Co. v. Day, 52 N. Y. Super.

Where a prospectus, offering for sale trustee&#x0027;s transferable certificates, states that such certificates represent stock deposited with the trus- tee, the stock being in an English corpo- ration, the trustee is personally liable if it turns out that the English corpora- tion had a prior lien on the stock to the full extent of its value. The trustee was bound to take notice of the lien
			created by the by-laws of the English corporation. The rule of caveat emptor has been relaxed so as to create an im- plied warranty of title on the part of the seller. Even though the trustee acted as agent, yet, the principal not being disclosed, the trustee is liable. 1McClure v. Central Trust Co., 105 N. Y. 108 (1900) o Coles v.

			§ 370. ?iglits of tran.sf&#x0027;rees who )troaTso aefter a registry has been obtainedl.--It has already been shown that the transferees of a certificate of stock which has been put in circulation by forgery are not allowed to retain such stock where there has not been, at soime time subsequent to the forgery, a translor registered on the corporate books. It has also been shown that he who applies to tile corporation for a registry of transfer, such registry being the first one since the forgery was committed, is not allowed to retain the stock. An entirely different rule prevails as regards all sub- sequent bona fJde holders of the new certificate obtained by the first registry. The person who obtains the first registry has no rights except as against his transferrer. But all subsequent purchasers without notice are fully protected. They cannot be compelled to give up the stock, either to the corporation or to the person who lost it by forgery.8 This rule arises, not from the law of negligence, but from the law of estoppel operating against the corporation. It is in accord with the demands of trade and the constant tendency of the law to protect bonafide purchasers of certificates of stock. l Bank of Ireland v. Evans Charities, 5 H. L.

			[ll. XXI. 1. CONPISCA&#x0027;IO&#x0027;(N OF STOCK. § 371. During the Into Rebelolion, acts of confiscation were passed both by tho United States government and by the Confederate government, and shalres of stock owned by parties in one section of the country in corporations domiciled in the otiler section were confiscatedl. Tho result of the war having established that tho .Confederate government was an illegal one, all its acts of confisca- tion became null and void, and all transfers and registers of stock therounder were held to be void utterly. The whole line of trans- actions based on the confiscation fell with the confiscation itself.&#x0027; The corporation was held not liable to purchasers whoso title was based on the conlliscation, since it acted under compulsion of a power tellmporarily greatter than the lavw itself.2 If the corporation neglects to remedy the confusion and claims growing out of the illegal con- liscation of stock, any stockholder may institute an&#x0027;action in its behalf for tilat purpose.3 The stock is to )e restored to the owner against whom the confiscation proceedings were hadl: and if the corporation, dluring theo Iebellion, voluntarily paid d(ividends to the illegal holders of tile stock, it must pay the same to the plairtiff, even though it would have been compelled to pay such dividends to the Southern holder if it had not done so voluntarily.4 On tih other hand, proceeoings for the confiscation of stock under the con- fiscation acts of the United States government, passed by reason of person in whose name the certificate is made out and to whom it is given is a shareholder in the company. and it is given by the company with the inten- tion that it shall be so used by the per- son to whom it is given, and acted upon in the sale and transfers of shares." A purchaser of certificates of stock need not look back of the last registry of transfer on the corporate books. A breach of trust back of tbat does not invalidate his title. Winter v. Mont- gomery Gaslight Co.. 89 Ala. 544 (1889). See also $ 358, supra. A corporation cannot refuse to transfer stock on the ground that the vendor fraudulently induced the company to issue the stock to him, where the company had been guilty of laches in not seeking a rem- edy before the transfer. The vendee in this case was a director. American Wire Nail Co. v. Bayless, 91 Ky. 94 (1891). "A secretary is amereservant.
			840
			His position is that he is to do what he is told, and no person can assume that he has any authority to represent any- thing at all." Ience a receipt by the secretary that certificates of stock had been actually lodged in the corporate oflice for transfer does not bind the corporation where they were not act- ually lodged, and the receipt was a part of a fraud.

These formalities are pc- culiar to sales of stock. The only analogy to them is perhaps that arising from the making of a (deed of real estate, and a registry of the same at a recorder&#x0027;s office. In many respects, however, this analogy does not apply. Thus, the corporation itself has many rights and duties herein which a register of deeds has not. The

			rules given heroin have arison for the most part out of the neces- sities and usages of business as sanctioned by the courts.
			§ 373. Th&#x0027;l twI!o tirtl telps in perfSecting a trasf.br of stocl.- To transfer a ahare of stock there are generally two distinct steps to be takoen: First, tiho certilicate is assigned by the transferrer to the transforeo; and second, tllat assignment and transfer are perfected and complleted by delivering the assigned certificate to the corpo- ration, obtaining an entry on the corporate transfer book to the elroct that the transferee has acquired the stock of the transferror, and taking from the corporation a new certilicate of stock certifying that the newly-recorded stockholder owns a specified amount of stolck. The corporation then cancels the old certilicato of stock1 and posts the transfer into the stock ledger.&#x0027;
			§ 374. Omission of /iller or lboth steps.- Either and even both of these two stops in the complete transfer of stock may be omitted; and yet, where tile facts estop the various parties from denying that a transfer has been made, it will be held to be complete. Thus, it has l.ien held that an owner of stock may transfer his stock to another by a delivery of the certificate without any as- signment.3 This happens when a registry of transfer is made with- out any surrender of the old certificate.&#x0027; So far as the transferrer is concerned such a method of transfer is effectual. Such cases also arise where tile corporation has never issued certificates of stock. The stockholder may then transfer his stock without assigning a certificate.5 A subscription of stock may be assigned, even though only a part of the subscription has been called for and paid, and even though no certificate of stock has ever been issued. Such as- signment may be oral.0 iNo certificate of stock is necessary in order
			In Knox v. Eden&#x0027; Musee, etc. Ca. 148 N. Y. 441 (1890), certificates of stock had been delivered to the corporation for transfer, and the new certificates had been duly issued. The old certifi- cates were put in a safe uncanceled, tnnd were illegally abstracted by an em- ployee and sold. The court held that the company was not liable on such certificates to a person who took them in pledge from such employee. The court, however, based its decision, not on the fact that the pledgee took with notice, but on the principle of law tlb.t, no one could acquire title to stolen cer- tificates of stock. &#x0027; The purposes of the stock-ledger are explained in § 14, supra.

Although the charter prescribes that stock shall be transferred in such manner as the by-laws direct, yet, if the by-laws do not provide for transfers, a common- law transfer is sufficient. An oral transfer is sufficient where no certifi- cates have been issued, and where such transferee is entered on the corporate books as a stockholder. Kiely v. Smyth, 27 Grant&#x0027;s Ch.

Usual forms of as.siglmlent and iowers of attorneyla wercblj the transferrer tassigls tthe certificate of stock to his trans.frcee.-- A certificate of stock is a paper issued by the corporation to a stock- holder, stating that tile person specified therein is the owner of a certain number of shares of its capital stock. The assignment of this certificate is made, it seems, in three different ways: First, it has been held that it may be made by a simple delivery of the cer- tilicate without any writing.4 Where a deed of trust refers to cer- tain stock and transfers the same to the trustee and authorizes him to transfer the stock to himself on the books, an indorsement of the certificates is unnecessary to pass title to tie trustee.5 Again, it may be made by a formal instrument of assignment duly signed by tile transferrer. This instrument may be separate from the certifi- cate of stock or may be printed in blank on the back of it. In either case, in order to make the transfer complete by a registry of it on the corporate books, it is necessary for the transferrer to go to

			tile ollice of the corporation iand sign the transfer in the corporate transfer bool, wllereby tle transfer is recorded. The third and most usual method of assigning a certificate of stock is by a formal instrument of assignment, similar to tile one explained above, united with a power of attorney authorizing a person, whose name is gen- erally loft blank, to be subsequently filled in, to sign the corporate&#x0027; transfer book, wlhereby the transfer is recorded. This instrument of transfer and the power of attorney are generally printed in blank on the back of the certificate of stock. It onables the transferee to obtain a registry without the presence of the transferrer, pro- vidled the corporate registry agent is satisfied with the signature and intent of the transferrer to assign tile stock. Although a transfer is on a separate pieu of paper, anti is not acknowledged as req(uired by a rule of the stock exchange, nevertheless a pledgee may be a bon tido holder.&#x0027; A person who signs as a witness a forged transfer of stock is personally liable, even though he did so without knowledge of the fraud.2 The blank power of attorney is generally filled in by the transfer clerk, who inserts his own name and thereby becomes the attornoy.2 This power of attorney is not revoked by the death of the transferrer before it is usedl. A gen- eral power of attorney to sell land and build houses does not justify a sale of stock.&#x0027; A general power of attorney authorizing an agent to sell and transfer stocks, etc., authorizes him to sign the stock- holder&#x0027;s name to a transfer, but not a transfer to himself." Per- mitting, without inquiry, a transfer under a power of attorney thirteen years old is not proper vigilance on the part of a corpora- tion.7 An agent&#x0027;s written authority to transfer stock is revoked by death.8 A transferee who receives new certificates of stock is not l Smith v.

			§ 370. Qtestions which arise h7erdnl.- The assignment of a certifi- cate of stock by tile transferrer to the transferee, considered apart from the actual registry of such assignment on the corporate books, involves tile question whether such an assignment should be under seal; whether, after the assignment and the delivery thereof, the transferrer can claim any rights of ownership as against the trans- seree, even though there be no registry of the transfer; and whether a transfer and power of attorney duly signed by the trans- ferrer, but left in blank as to the name of the transferee and attor- ney, are legal and may pass from hand to hand until some holder cares to lill up the blanks. These and incidental questions are discussed in the following sections.
			§ 377. A seal is not necssary to a transfer of stocl.--In America an assignment or transfer of a certificate of stock need not be under seal.2 Formerly it was the custom to have all such transfers made by deed, duly sealed. As the nature of stock and certificates of stock, however, came to be understood more clearly, it became a rule of law that a transfer of the certificate, like the transfer of choses in action, did not require a seal. Not even the presence of the seal gives the transfer the character of a sealed instrument. The seal is a superfluity and is disregarded.3
			In England, on the other hand, transfers of railway stocks are generally required by charter to be under seal. This is hold to give the instrument the character of a deed; and hence, in accordance with the ancient technical rule of law that a deed must be filled out as to the grantee and other essential particulars before it is sealed in order to be valid, it has been held in England that a transfer of a certificate of stock, duly signed and sealed, but with the name of the transferee in blank, is void absolutely.&#x0027; In those English com-

On close examination of the cases which soeln to militate against it, it will bo found that the issue involved was whether the un- registered transferee was protected against third persons who claimed title back of the transferrer. The transferrer himself is not allowed to impeach his unregistered transferee&#x0027;s title. Even in Connecticut, where at an early day the court held that the registry was the origin of the title of the transferee, the court was consider- ing the rights of third persons, and not the rights of the transferrer Tramways Union Co., L R. 14 Q.

The transforee is estopped also from attacking the assignment of tho certificate on tho ground of inlormalities in tlh transfer.3 A bo;lafido plodge of stock indorsed in blank on tho back is protectedl.&#x0027; In 1Maryland, however, a distinction is drawn between the rights of a bona fido purchlaser and a bona Jfie pledgee.

			11. METII10D 1OF lEGIS&#x0027;l&#x0027;EIINO A TRIANSFI:R OF STOOK. § 381. olicistry an important part of a transfer of stock.- The effect of obtaining a registry or neglecting to a registry of the transfer on tlh corporate 1ooks, ilmmediately after purcllasing a certificate of stock, lhas given rise to much litigation and Illuc apparent confusion. A registry of the transfer is important in two resl)ects: First, as regards the rights of the purchaser in reference to the corporation; second, in regard to the rights of the purchaser as to third persons who are cither creditors of the old registered stockholders or have claims upon the stock in question. So far as the corporation is concerned, it is bound to recognize only the reg- istered stockholder.2 To him is accorded the right to vote, draw dividends, and exercise the general right of stocliholdership. The unregistered purchaser of stock cannot claim such rights. All the cases agree in this result of a neglect to register a transfer. As re- gards the rights of third persons, however, the courts of the differ- ent states vary widely in tleir opinions. (enerally the question arises by reason of an attachment or execution levied by a creditor of the transferrer against thle stock standing on the corporate books in the name of the transferrer, who has already sold and assigned tlie certificate of stock to another. As a general rule, it may be said that a purchaser of a certificate of stock is usually protected as fully without a registry on tile corporate books as he would be by a registry, so far as subsequent attachments and most other pos- sible equities against the stock are concerned.3 This is the rule in 1 Broadway Bank v. McElrath, 13 N. 479 (1877); Leavitt v. Fisher, 4 Duer, 1, J. Eq. 24 (1860); Matthews v. Massaclu- 20 (1854). setts Nat. Bank, 1 Holmes, 300 (1874); 2Registry herein means not only an s.c., 16Fed.

			New York and most of the states. In some other states a contrary rule prevails. In Massachusetts, Illinois, New hamtpshlire, and elsowhero, statutes havo changed tile old rule so that it now accords with tliat of Now York.i It is to be borne in mind also that a lion ill bohalf of tlh corporation may attacli after transfer of the cer- tilicate and before registration thereof.&#x0027;
			§ 382. F]ormaliltes ofmlains rc&#x0027;ti.titri - Traiisfer book and slock7 ledilosr lot Jtec&#x0027;&#x0027;St1rl.-&#x0027; The customiIIar mctlthod of registering a tranls- for of stock on tile corporate books is simple. The register(l stock- holder, or his attorney in fact, whose nnaeo is written in til blank &#x0027; power of attorney, applies to the corporate oilleer having charge of the transfer books, and requests a registry of the transfer to a person designatedl Iy a name written in tle form of transfer. Books of transfer are kept for pulrposes of registering, and upon such an application and the surrender of the old certificate til old stock- holler or his attorney makes the registry and a now certificate is issuel.3
			Any suitable registry or stock list, or formal entry on the corpo- rate books, sullices. No special book need be kept for that pur- pose.4 Where the stock book of the corporation is locked up and cannot be reachedl, the tlirectors m:ay adopt a new stock book and minute book, and make transfers of stock." Where the company does not keep a transfer book, the transfer of stock is complete when the owner of stock transfers the certificate on the back and delivers it to the secretary in order that a new certificate may be issued to the transferee.0 In fact the usefulness of a transfer
			lThis statute is referred to in § 488, infra. 2 See ch. XXXI, infra. Inasmuch as by the laws of England an English cor- poration may amend its by-laws so as to give it a lien on stock which will be priortoany existing unregistered pledge or assignment of the certificates of stock, an American pledgee or holder of such certificates of stock is bound by such by-law. Hudson, etc. Co. v. Warner &#x0026;Co.. 99 Fed. Rep. 187 (1900). 3Burrall v. Bushwick R. R, 75 N. Y. 211 (1878); Green Mount, etc. Co. v. Bulla. 45 Ind. 1 (1873). See also § 375, supra. 4 ,All that is necessary, when the transfer is required by law to be made upon the books of the corporation, is that the fact should be appropriately recorded in some suitable register or
			851
			stock list, or otherwise formally en- tered upon its books. For this purpose the account in a stock ledger, showing the names of the stockholders, the num- ber and amount of the shares belong- ing to each, and the sources of their title, whether by original subscription and payment or by derivation from others, is quite suitable, and fully meets the requirements of the law." National Bank v. Watsontown Bank, 105 U. S. 217 (1881). 5Re Argus Co., 138 N. Y. 557 (1893). 6 Chemical Nat. Bank v. Colwell, 132 N. Y. 250 (1891). A stockholder is lia- ble by statute on stock where he has merely transferred the certificate and no effort has been made to complete the transfer on the corporate books; but where there is no transfer book, and the certilicates are merely can- oCl.

			book may well be doubted, and unless the statutes require it there is a strong largullimelnt in favor of abolishing it. Probably the trals- for book, and tile power of attornoy on tlh back of cortificates of stock, and tlh provision in tlo certificate of stock that it can be transferre(d on the books of the comlpany only in person or by lduly authlorized attorney, inight be abolished without harm. In these days i stlo alnd assignmllent los tho ccr&#x0027;itictttc of stook should be sus- ficient to warrant a corporation making a transfer on its corporate books upon tile presentation of tho old certificate so assiglned. Tile fact is that tile transfer on tho transfer book is a incro repetition of the transfer on the back of the certificate of stock, and as tho stock ledger can be posted directly from the canceled certillcatcs of stock, thl transfer book might well be abolished. A stock journal might. be convenient to show the daily transfers. The certiicate of stock book, the stoclk journal and stock ledger would then correspond to tile day-book, journal and ledger in ordinary book-keeping. But in these days, when it is tile rule to issue certilicates of stock, celed and new ones issued, this is suffi- cient to effect a transfer on the corpo- rate books. Plumb v. Ban k of Enterprise, 48 Kan. 184 (1892). Where the corpo- ration keeps a stock-certificate book but no transfer book, . transfer on the back of a certificate, which is then canceled and pasted back in the certificate book, and a new certificate issued to the transferee, is a sufficient transfer to constitute a transferee a.stockholder. He may vote at elections, and an as. signment by the corporation on the direction of officers elected by such a transferee is valid. Such a transfer is valid also, although a by.law provided that before selling his stock a stock- holder must offer it to other stockhold- ers for purchase. American Nat. Bank v. Oriental Mills, 17 IL 1. 551 (1891). A certificate-of-stock book is sufficient to show stockholdership, if there are no transfer or stock books, even though the statute requires the latter to be kept. Knowles v. Sandercock, 107 Cal. 629 (1895). A mere memorandum of a sale of stock, made by the corporation in the certificate book, was held a sus- ficient transfer to sustain a lien in Bank of Commerce v. Bank of Newport, 63 Fed. Rep. 898 (1894). Where the cor- poration keeps no stock ledger, a trans-
			852
			for is sufficiently registered when the old certificate is surrendered, a new one issued, and the new name enterod on the subscription list. Stewart r. Wnlla Walla, etc. Co., 1 Wash. St. 521 (1881)). Where no slock or transfer books are kept, although the statute requires them, and the certificate of stock is so kept that upon a transfer the old certificates of stock are not pasted back on to the stubs correspond- ing thereto, the transferrer may be lia- ble for subsequent debts, even though a new certilicate was issued to the transferee and the stub opposite thereto stated from whom the stock was trans- ferred. Herrick v. Wardwell, 58 Ohio St. 294 (1898). Under the New York statute a holder of unpaid stock is not relieved from liability by a transfer of the same, unless such transfer is reg- istered in a stock book; and it is held that even though no stock book is kept by the corporation, yet, if the trans- ferrer was an officer of the company and partially responsible for not hav- ing such book kept, he cannot set up the defense that no such book was kept, especially where there is evidence of bad faith in the transfer. Beals v. Buffalo, etc. Co., 49 N. Y. App. Div. 589 (1900).

			and a transfer thereof transfers teo equitable title to the stoolc ilsolf in all tho states, and tile legal title in most of the states, every legal and equitablo right can be preserved as well with- out a transfer book and power of attorney as with tiheni. Tlhe practical result would be tile saving of transfer books and much bookkeeping. Malny smiall corporations in these (lays (to not keep any transfer book at all, and yet they experience no lilllculty in transferring stool;. Of course where the statutes of a state, ts in XNew Jersey, require the keeping of a transfer book, the above suggestions could not be adopted. A demaind for registry of a transfer of stock should bo made upon the principal olllcer or clerk at the ollice of the corporation. When so made it is sullicient.&#x0027; Tile elothod of registry may be regulated by the by-laws of the corporation. Thus, a by-law that tile stock shall bo transferable by indorsement in writing, mnade in tle presence of the caslier or two other witnesses, has been sustainedl as valid, and is complied witil only by the presence and signature of the cashier or of tile witnesses.2 So, also, of a by-law requiring registry in the presence of the president and secretary of the company.3 PBut a by-law re- quiring the assent of the president of the corporation to the registry of a transfer would be in restraint of trade and void.4 It is legal for a corporation to enact a by-law requiring stockholders to pay a small fee on making transfers of their stock upon the corporate books.5 A delivery of certificates to the corporation, and a more request to the corporate ollicers to make the transfer, is not a com- i" It is sufficient for him to apply at the bank during tile usual hours of business and make his demand upon the officers and clerks who may be in attendance there; and, in case they are not authorized to transact that partic- ular business, they must either refer himi to the proper officer in the bank or procure the attendance of such offi- cer, or of the board of directors, if neces- sary, without any unreasonable delay. . . . In the absence of any proof to the contrary, it may be fairly pre- sumned that the principal officer or clerk in attendance at the bank, during the usual hours of business, is authorized to permit such a transfer whlen proper."

			Tllo fact that tile registry clerk marks on the instrument of transfer tilo words "received for record" does not constitute t registry.&#x0027; A nmemooranldum on tile stock book thlt the stock lias been transferred as collateral security is sulllcient to givo the trans- ser precedence over an nttachment.0 It lias been hell that, where tlie corporation has at branch registry ollco in another state, it reg- istry in tile brancl oliceo is not an effectual registry until it lias been reported and entered in the books of tlh miain ollIco of tlh corporation.7 It has been held in lowa that wioro an Iowa cor- poration keeps its stock books in .Boston, a transfer on such books in Boston is not effectivo as against subsequent attachments on the stock in Iowa, unless a bookl is kept in Iowa showing all transfers as required by tile statutes of Iowa.s If tile corporation does not keep books for the registry of transfers of stock, a mcroe notice to tile corporation that a transfer has been made constitutes a reg- istry.0 But if tile statute or charter requires a transfer to be madlo on tlle corporate books, no registry is possible until such books are obtainled and openedl.&#x0027; If tlhe corporation never issues certificates of stock, the stockholder cannot demand them.11 If the corporation cannot allow tile registry on account of an injunction, it is never- lBrown v.

Smith, 2 Conn. 570 (1818). 2 See § 258, supra. 3See § 490, infra. Under the Iowa statute a transfer of stock is not es- fective as against creditors, even though a request has been made to the corpo- ration to transfer the stock, if such transfer has not been made. and even though the corporation attached to the stub of the certificate an acknowledg- ment of the assignment of the certifi- cate, and even though the attaching creditor knew of such request.

			§ 387. CoQor1ora)lio mayl iltelde7ad betlween two cl7(aimants to stooke. Tile task imposed upon t. corporation in determining whother to refuse or to allow a registry of stock is a dililcult and (dangorous one. It is easy to avoid tilo risk of forgery or of failure of the lap- plicant to identify himself. lhlt circuLmstances frequently are suci that the corporation dare not allow registry to either of two par- ties, each of whlom claims to be the solo and absolute owner of tlh stock, and each of whlom claims the right of registry or notifies til corporation not to register the other claimant as a stockholder. These cases arise on various occasions, but most often where tlhe stock has been attached or sold on execution by the translorrer&#x0027;s creditors before the tralnsfree has obtained registry; or where, by the fraud of the old stockholder&#x0027;s agent, the certilicate has plasse( into theo lnds of a bona lide purchaser; or where, by a broach of trust, an executor or administrator, or trustee or guardian, has sold the trust stock and appropriated the procceds; or under other states of fact wherein there are two claimants of the stock, each having rights which can be clearly ascertained only by litigation. It is not incumbent on the corporation to decide between these conilict- ing parties and rights.t Such a requirement would expose it to unreasonable risks and compel it to assume the functions of a court. Where there is a reasonable doubt as to the facts involved or as to the respective rights of the claimants of the stock, and the corpo- ration is sued by one of the claimants for refusing to allow a registry by him, the corporation may interplead, and thus compel the claim- ants to ascertain their rights through the medium of a court of justice.2 A similar interpleader may be made where the corpora- It must not be exercised corruptly, or fraudulently, or arbitrarily, or capri- ciously, or wantonly. It may not beexer- cised for a collateral purpose. In exer- cising it the directors must act in good faith in the interest of the company and with due regard to the sharehold- er&#x0027;s right to transfer his shares, and they must fairly consider the question of the transferee&#x0027;s fitness at a board meet- ing." It is not a sufficient reason that the transferee is not a member of a par- ticular family, and the directors will be ordered to make the transfer. Re Bell, 65 L. T. Rep. 245 (1891). See also S 622, infra.

Whero the real owner of stock brings suit against a transforeo of that stoolc who has ob. tained a new certificato therefor and succeeds in the suit, and in the mean- time the defendant has assigned the stock to a third party, the corporation may institute suit and interplead be- tween the successful claimant of the stock and the transferee of tho stock from the defendant. The defendant in tho former suit need not be joined as a party in the latter suit. The purchaser of the certificate may be enjoined from transferring the same. and may be compelled to deposit the certificate with the clerk of the court. American, etc. Assoc. v. Brantingham, 57 N. Y. App. Div. 399 (1001). If the court de- cides that the interpleader is properly filed by the corporation herein, it gen- erally on a motion dismisses the pro- ceeding with costs to the corporation, and the court also decides between the defendants if the case is ready as be- tween them. If not ready, it directs an action or an issue, or a reference to
			a master, to ascertain contested facts, as may he bust suited to thio nature of the case: "or tile court may leave it to tile defendants to prepare tieo caso be. tween them as they may eo advis"d, which would be tile effect of a general order to intorplead."

			to act, and to compel the claimnnts to litigato between themselves before it allows a registry to oither. The policy of the law doubt- loss is to go very far in allowing the corporation to refuse to incur responsibility by taking action. Where, however, the rights of one claimant aro reasonably clear, the corporation should suspend action for a reasonable time within which the contesting party may com- Inenco suit; and if no such action is brought it slould allow aI reg- istry by the first-named claimant.&#x0027; Any other rule would enable any person to practically deprive a stockholder of the possession of his stock temporarily, by simply notifying the corporation that he claims the stock.&#x0027;3 Whore, however, the corporation has allowed jurisdiction in order to decree a trans. for. Spencer v. James, 10 Tox. Civ. App. 827 (1805). In Langston v. Ioylston, 2 Vesey, Jr. 101 (1703), where a baileo of bonds was sued by the bailor for con- version for not delivering up the bonds to the latter, ilthough attachments hlad been levied on them, the bailee aus. tainoed a bill of interpleader. In Cady v. Potter, 05 Barb. 403 (1809), a corpora- tion sustained its bill of interpleader as between a person to whom it had issued stock on a transfer without a surrender of the old certificate and a person to whom it afterwards issued the stock on a surrender of the old certificate. The author himself, as recently as 1897, has maintained, in the New York supreme court, a suit of interpleader by a cor. poration as between two claimants of stock, together with an injunction against the prosecution of a suit at law commenced by one of the claimants against the corporation for damages for refusal to transfer the stock. A broker cannot interplead between his customer and an indorser of the customer&#x0027;s note, in regard to stocks deposited with the broker by the customer, even though the administrator of the indorser claims that he has an interest in such stock. Post v. Emmett, 40 N. Y. App. Div. 477 (1899). A person holding stock in escrow under an option agreement may interplead between the parties in interest if they make conflicting claims. Walker v. Bamberger, 17 Utah, 239 (1898).
			1 State v. MIlver, 2 8. C. 25 (1870). A corporatlon cannot interplead as be- tween stockholders for the purpose of determining the ownership of stock, there having been no claim made upon it in regard to registry or in regard to dividends. It must be shown also that the company has not acted in a partisan manneras between tle different claim- ants. Hinckley v. Pllster, 88 Wis. 04 (1892). If tlie corporation allows a trans- ser to be made during the pendency of a suit between two claimants therefor, and the corporation has notice, it is not liable to the successful party, who is thereby deprived of the stock, there having been no injunction pendente lit. Hawes r. Gas, etc. Co., 12 N. Y. Supp. 924 (1891). An interpleader may be proper even though no suit has been actually commenced against the corpo- ration. See Story&#x0027;s Eq. Juris., § 808; Daniell, Ch. PI. &#x0026; Pr., pp. 1561, 1564, notes. In New York, under the Codeof Civil Procedure, an order for inter- pleader can only be granted after a suit has been commenced against the cor- poration. Buffalo Grape Sugar Co. v.

			FORlMA i&#x0027;llTES OF &#x0027;TIIANSFEIt ANI) IEGISTOIY.
			[on. xXIr. strong line of decisions, however, wliich holds that a mlanlramsnw ldos lie to compel a corporotion to allow a registry of a transfer of stock, particularly where tile corporation has no good and suili- ciont reason for refusing the registry.&#x0027; Perhaps tile strongest argument against granting a mantdams for this purpose lies in tho fact that by a bill in equity not only can a registry be specifically decreed and ordered by the court, but the rights of the corporation and of all of the claimants mIay be fully and finally hoard and dis- posed of.
			§ 391. IRemedy by suit in equtity.-- This is the surest, most com- plete, andl most just remedy for compelling a corporation to reg- Eingland to compol it to register a trans- for of stock to an individual and a cor- poration jointly. Law Guarantee, etc. Soc. v. Bank of England, L. R. 21 Q. B. D. 400 (1890). 3Mlndat us is not the proper remedy to compel the issue of a certificate of stock. State v. Carpenter, 51 Ohio St. 83 (181)1). Under the stat- utes of Georgia it is held that man- lda1mns does not lie to compel a transfer of stock, unless the transfer is con- nected with a judicial sale: and even though a sale is made by a trustee ap- pointed by a court and he has been authorized to sell the stock, yet this is not sufficient to sustain mandamlrs.

P. 254 (1863), hold- ing also that the mandamus may run to the corporation itself without speci- fying any officers, and that an evasive answer.by them is equivalent to a re- fusal to register. It has been held that mandamus will issue to aid the sheriff
			In transferring stock sold on an execu- tion sale. This rule, however, would work harshly in states where the pur- chaser of the outstanding certificate may have soein rights. Where such a possibility exists the lnsl((ldamnuis should be denied. State v. First Nat. Bank, 89 Ind. 302 (1883); Bailey t. Strohecker, 38 Ga. 259 (1808); l)urham v. Monumental, etc. Co., 9 reg. 41 (1880). Cf. § 489, infra. dlandallus will lie to compel the corporation to transfer the stock on its books where any other record would be inadequate because there is no market value for the stock, and be- cause thie company has fraudulently transferred its property for the purpose of injuring the value of tle stock. Tle nanldarlus will lie although a suit is pending in equity to accomplish the same purpose. Sleminons v. Tiomp- son, 23 Oreg. 215 (1892). Mlanidamuslies to compel a corporation to transfer stock sold under levy of execution. It may be granted as a common-law remedy or as a remedy ancillary to the suit. Hair v. Burnell, 100 Fed. Rep. 280 (1900). Where the purchaser of stock at execution sale applies for a man- damus to compel the corporation to transfer the stock to him, and the owner of the stock intervenes and claims that the debt on which the stock was sold had been paid, and asks for a delivery of the certificates to the owner, the case may be tried in equity.

Y. 174 (1820, reversing 0 N. Y. Supp. 800). a court of equity com- pelled the trustees of a trust to trans- ser on their books trust certificates which had been purchased in open market by a person.who then applied to the trustees for a transfer. The court based its decision on the similarity of such trust certificates to stock certifi- cates. and said: "The denial of the right to transfer upon the books is not consistent with the transferable quality of the shares, which imports that the purchaser taling an assignment of theim in a duly formal manner lhas the right to become a transferee within the meaning of the agreement upon which the trust was formed. . . In such case it is within the equitable power of the court to compel such transfer to be made." The court held also that it was immaterial that the purchaser who applied for the transfer was hostile to and a competitor of the trust. The court said that although it would have been legal in tle beginning to have vested a discretion in the trustees as to allow- ing transfers, yet that, such discretion not having been reserved, it could not be exercised by the directors. See also White r. Price, 39 Hun, 395 (1880): asf&#x0027;d, 108 N.Y. Y001 (1888); Iron R. R. v. Fink, 41 Ohio St. 321 (1884), the court saying that the power of equity to decree a

			registry Is well settled. As regards tho pleadings, see Burrall v. Bushwick 1. R., 75 N. Y. 211 (1878), See also § 579, infra. A purchaser of stock at an ex- ecution sale may file a bill against an alleged transferee of the stock and the corporation to havo the conflicting rights adjudicated. Howard v. Corey, 120 Ala. 283 (1900). In an action against the secretary of a corporation to com- pel hlin to register a transfer of stock, the corporation is not a necessary party. Gould v. Head, 41 Fed. Rep. 2.10 (1800). The federal courts have jurisdiction of a suit in equity brought by a citizen of one state to compel a corporation of another state to transfer on its books certain shares of stock wvhiho the com- plainant purchased from a citizen of the same state as the defendant. Jew- ett v. Bradford, etc. Co., 45 Fed. Rep. 801 (1801). If the holder of a certificate of stock has applied for transfer and been refused. he may sue for the divi- dend before bringing a suit in equity to obtain a transfer of his stock. Hill v. Atoka, etc. Co., 21 S. W. Rep. 508 (Mo. 1893). This case arose again in 124 Mo. 153. An agreement of the holder of a majority of the stock that he will re- tain control is no defense by the corpo- ration to an action by the receiver of such stockholder to transfer tile stock on the corporate books. Weller .; Pace Tobacco Co., 25 N. Y. Week. Dig. 531 (1880). A pledgee of a certificate of stock is not bound by an agreement of all the stockholders to surrender to the corporation a part of their stock, which part is to be then considered preferred stock, and is to be sold by the corpora- tion for the purpose of paying corpo- rate debts. Although all the other stock has had this agreement stamped on the certificates, yet the corporation cannot insist that the purchaser of the

The purchaser may file a bill in equity to determine his rights. The court found it unnecessary to pass on the question as to whether such n restric- tion as to the stock is legal. Spurgeon v. Santa Ana, etc. Co., 120 Cal. 71 (1898). A bill in equity lies to compel a corpo- ration which has declared a stock divi- dend to stockholders of record on July 1st, to deliver such stock dividend to a purchaser on July Oth whose purchase included such dividend.

Where the title to stock is litigated in a suit in equity and an officer of the corpora- tion is a party defendant, being inter- ested in the transaction, the court may compel him in that suit to transfer tle stock on the corporate books, even though the corporation is not a party to the suit. Durfee v. Harper, 22 Mont. 354 (1899). A corporation by the action of its board of directors and consent of all of its stockholders may agree that a certain percentage of its profits shall be paid annually to a person for serv- ices already rendered by him. In a suit by him to enforce such agreement and asking an injunction against any sales of stock, except with notice of such agreement, stockholders are nec- essary parties defendant. Such an agreement is not an exclusion of future boards of directors from the manage- ment of the company. Dupignac v. Bernstrom, 70 N. Y. App. Div. 105 (1902). 868

Purl).ose of the chlalter.- It is proposed in this chapter, as a continuation of the last, and as a recapitulation of the various rights, liabilities, and duties of the corporation in refusing or allowing a registry of a transfer of stock, to state briefly the rules which prevail herein. The standpoint taken is that of the corpora- tion. The minute and particular application of the general rules governing this subject are not stated here at length; but an effort has been made to give, in systematic order, certain directions which will enable a corporation, when in doubt as to whether to allow or refuse a registry, to decide the question intelligently and safely.
			i 394. Right to rel&#x0027;se intil the transferrer pays th7e lunpaid sub- scriptiollprice.&#x0027;-A corporation cannot refuse to register a transfer of stock merely because the subscription price has not been fully paid in, unless the charter or the statutes of the state expressly give that right. Nor can it refuse registry, even though a call for part of the subscription price has been made, is due, and remains unpaid. It must allow registry, but may continue to hold the transferrer liable for the call. The corporation has no lien on the stock for the subscription price, nor has it a right to restrict trans- sers until calls or parts of the subscription price not yet called are paid. The policy of the law is to favor the right of transfer, and
			1 See ch. XV, sulpra.
			872

	<page id="01450">
		<ocrText>
			no impediments by the corporation are allowed to restrict that right. As regards parts ol the subscription not yet called in, the transferrer is released from andi the transferoo assumes the liability. As regards calls nmad before the applicaltion for registry, but not yet due, tile transferror is liable, but, it seems, not tile transferee. As regards calls made beforo the application and duo before such, the translferer and not tih transferee is liable. As regards calls inmad after tlhe application the transeroee alone is liablo. In some states, however, dilfferent rule prevails, and by statute the trans- ferrer, if ho is the original subscriber, is liable until the whole sub- scription is paid.
			§ 3ni. Whether tw e7 cor)oration nuay refuse to ;register a tranjsfer to anl irreslponsible tra.sfy/ree.1- Greater dflilculty is experienced in finding a working rule on this subject. On one point, however, all the authorities agree. If the corporation is insolvent, or in such a state of decline that insolvency seems inevitable, the cor- poration may refuse to allow a registry of transfer from a respon- sible to an irresponsible insolvent transferee. The policy of tle law is to protect corporate creditors, even at tile expenso of restricting the rigllt of transfer. The above rule applies not only wvhere the subscription is unpaid, but also where it has been paid and only a statutory liability exists. Where, however, the corpo- ration is solvent, and a stockholder applies for a registry of transfer from himself to an irresponsible transferee, it seems that the cor- poration cannot refuse to make the registry.
			§ 390. Corlporation lmal reflise to &#x0027;register as transferees persons rho (are incompeten t to contract.Y -If the transferee of a certificate of stock is an infant or person of unsound mind, the corporation may refuse to register such transferee as a stocklholder. The rea- son of the rule is that such persons would not be obliged at law to respond to the obligations of a stockholder, and consequently are not entitled to its privileges. With married women at the present day the law is different. At common law they were incompetent to become stockholders, as is an infant at the present time. But the statutes of all the states have substantially removed these dis- abilities, and enabled a married woman to transact business as a fcmoe sole, so far as her separate estate is concerned. Slh may be- come a stockholder in a corporation, but cannot bind her husband&#x0027;s estate for the liabilities of such stockholdership.
			§ 397. Trustees, executors, fl.auordians, a(gents, pldqgees.3- In reg- istering a transfer to a trustee, executor, or guardian, the corpora- tion may be required to register the transferee as holder in his official capacity. A trustee who purchases or receives stock to l See ch. XV, supra.

			hlold in trust for the benefit of another Inay, it scoms, require the corporation to register the transror and issue new cortilloates to himself in his own namn as " trustee." In England the rule ap- pears to be different. The reason of this rule is that the liability of a trustee on stock is in many of the states different from that of a compllete owner of til stock, and also because, where stock is leoll by a trustee as such, it is thoe duty of tile corporation to refuse to allow the trustee to sell and register a sale of the stock unless the instrument creating the trust authorizes such sale. So also an executor or aldiniistrator or guardianl may compel the corporation to place his ollicial title after his name in the stock registry. I&#x0027;ledgees, however, and agents have not this right. The corpora- tion may, but is not obliged to, write the word " pledgee" after the transferee&#x0027;s naale either in the stock registry or on the cortili- cate. Such is the rule, for the reason that the corporation is not obliged to protect the rights of the ple(lgor, nor to recognize &#x0027;tho pledgeeship of the transferee. The same rule applies to transferees who take as agents of the transferrer.
			§ 398. Sales b/&#x0027;.stock by eccrtors or aldmiistratoris.- A corpora- tion may with safety, and in fact is obliged to, allow a (lomestic executor or administrator to register a transfer of the sale of stock belonging to the estate upon presentation by the executor or ad- ministrator of the letters testamentary or letters of administration. The executor or administrator may then register a transfer of the stock to himself as executor or administrator, or directly from the name of the deceased to a purchaser from the executor; or from the deceased to the executor, and then from the executor to the purchaser. One executor may sell and register a transfer of the stock. The corporation is not bound to inquire whether it is neces- sary that the sale be made in order to pay the debts of the estate, nor to see to it that the executor actually applies the proceeds of the sale to that purpose. Where, however, the corporation has actual knowledge through its officers that a breach of trust is con- templated by the executor, it is bound to refuse registry, and will be liable to the estate for neglecting so to do. So, also, where such a long time has elapsed between the taking out of the letters and the sale by the executor that the latter has become practically a trustee, the corporation must use the same precaution as in sales by a trustee. In the case of specitic legacies of stock, the corporation need not protect them, but may allow the executor to transfer the stock into his own name as executor, since he may need it to pay debts, and the corporation is not bound to investigate such ques- tions. In England it is held that the corporation is liable for allow-

			ing la transfer by foreign executors without payment of an inher- itainco tax.
			§ 399. Sales by tr&#x0027;stees.&#x0027;- A trustee who holds stock belonging to tle trust estate has no right to soil and transfer such stock un- less lio is expressly authorized so to do by the instrumenot creating the trust. Consequently the law imposes upon the corporation the duty of refusing to allow a trustee to transfer the stock unless ie clearly has a right so to do. If the corporation neglects tis duty it is liable to the trust estate, and, in ease of a breach of trust by the trustee, may be compelled to replace the stock or pay damnages. If the trustee has an express power given to him to sell, the corpo- ration may allow him to make the transfer. If no such power is given, &#x0027;the corporation must refuse. Thli trustee is bound to rea- sonably satisfy the corporation of his right, but the corporation cannot permanently retain the papers submitted to it for that pur- pose.
			§ 400. Sales Jby gParlits.((l2-A guardian has a right to change the investment of the funds in his charge, and consequently has a right to sell stock held by him in his official capacity. Accordingly, the corporation may allow him to register a transfer of stock held by him as guardian, and cannot require the guardian to obtain an order or decree from a court authorizing such transfer. An order or decree is often obtained by the guardian, however, for his own protection, and is to be commended. In New York the rights and duties of guardians are regulated by statute, and other states have similar statutes.
			§ 401. Forgery of tramnsfer.3- A corporation is bound and re- quired to detect a forgery whereby the name of the owner of a cer- tificate of stock is signed to it and a transfer made which the corporation is requested to register. The stockholder in whose name the old certificate was made out, and whose name was forged to the transfer, may hold the corporation liable if it fails to detect the forgery and allows a registry of the forged transfer. Hle may com- pel it to replace the stock or pay damages. This rule is due to the fact that the corporation is a custodian of the books whereby a stockholder obtains his rights of stockholdership, and it cannot de- prive him of these rights by allowing others to take them from him by the aid of the corporation and without his consent. It is in the power of the corporation to require the presence of the transferrer at the time of registry, or at least clear proof that the signature is genuine. The corporation, however, has recourse over against the person who applied for registry on the forged transfer, however 1 See cli. XIX, supra.

			innocent the latter may be. ITo is hold to have impliedly ropro- sented that the transfer was genuine.
			§ 0o2. Corporatiou must rcequire a sutrrender of the outstanding ceolrictle.&#x0027;--If a corporation permits a registry of a transfer of stock, and issues new certificates to the transferror without requir- ing n surrender of the old certifcate, it assumos a (langerous posi- tion, andl one which it is not obliged to assunie. If the cortilicato which is not delivered up is in tle ;lntds of a bonafJi(ld purchaser for value and without notice, he may hold the corporation liable for allowing a registry of transl&#x0027;er to another without requiring a delivery of tile certificates. It is negligence and a b&#x0027; eiach of&#x0027; duty on the part of the corporation to allow a registry without a sur- render of the old certilicate. It generally refuses to do so, as is its duty, and is sustained by the law in its refusal. There aro occa- sions, however, where the law compels the corporation to register the transfer without a surrender of the old certificate. When so compelled to do, the corporation cannot be held liable by the pur- chaser of the outstanding certilicate, but he must seek his remedy against others. Such coimpulsory registry, excusing the corpora- tion, maty exist in cases of alleged loss of the old certificate, a decree of a court compelling the registry, and, under the latter, an attach- ment or execution against the stock.&#x0027;-
			§ 403. A/leyed loss of the old ce rlificate.--According to the rule of nearly all the states, a corporation is not obliged to issue a new certilicate of stock to the owner of an old one, which lie alleges lie has lost, unless such person gives to the corporation a sufficient bond of indemnity to protect it against liability in case it turns out that the old certificate was not lost but was sold and passed into bonajfide hands. In New Y&#x0027;ork this rule is fixed by statute. Tho corporation is liable to the holder of the outstanding certificate, if it is outstanding, and consequently should be protected against that liability by a bond from the applicant for registry. In Louisiana a statutory advertisement is made and a bond of indemnity dispensed with. But in the other states the court compels the loser to give a bond, varying in amount according to the amount of the stock and the clearness of the proof of loss.
			§404. Attachment or execution.4- Nearly all the states have laws whereby shares of stock are rendered subject to levy of at- tachment and to sale on levy of execution. When an execution sale, or an attachment followed by an execution sale, takes place in the state where the corporation exists, the purchaser at such sale generally has not the outstanding certificate, but nevertheless de-

			mannls registry of himself as stockholder in accordalnce with the law authorizing the attachmiont and execution. In the meantinlo the judgment debtor whoso stock is thus attached or sold under an execution generally may have sold his certificate or stock to a bone i/ido purchaser for value. If it happens that both parties claim the stock, the duty and privilege of the corporation is plain. It mlly refuse to decide between them, and when sded by either may interpload and compel the claimants to settle the right between thorn in the courts. But frequently it happens that the corpora- tion does not know whether the judgment debtor has sold the out- standing certificate or not. By the law of most of the states, if such certificate was sold before the attachment or execution was levied, the purchaser would be protected, and tle corporation would be liable to him for registering as a stockholder the pur- chaser at the execution sale. Accordingly, in that case, it is the duty of the corporation to refuse to register the purchaser at the execution sale. It cannot afford to take the risk, and is not obliged to take it. If the court then compels it to make the registry of transfer to the execution purchaser, the court will also, probably, compel such purchaser to give a bond of indemnity to protect the corporation. If such a bond is not required by the court, the cor- poration must nevertheless obey the decree. What rights the pur- chaser of the outstanding certificate would then have, has not as yet been passed upon by the courts.
			§ 405. Decree of a court t7ut cerlificates be isstued.&#x0027;-A corpora- tion must of.course obey the decree of a court that it issue a cer- tificate of stock to a specified person. But a court will rarely re- sort to such an extreme remedy where it is probable or possible that there may be an outstanding certificate in the hands of an innocent holder representing the same shares. As a principle of law the court has no power to decree such an issue ordinarily, since the whole capital stock has been issued, and its decree amounts practically to an order to make an overissue of stock. Generally the court decrees damages to be paid, or directs the cor- poration to purchase stock for the purpose of reissuing it to the specified party. This occurs frequently where the corporation has unjustly deprived a person of his stock. A different class of cases arises where the corporation has refused to allow a registry be- cause the outstanding certificate is not surrendered. Such cases include those of alleged loss of certificate, an execution sale of the stock, and, possibly, a suit in equity at the domicile of the corpora- tion to recover from another stock which the complainant claims. A decree in such a suit in most states would be ineffectual to de-

			privo of his righlts ono who purchased from tho defendant his cer- tillcate of stock before the decree Iwas rendered. It would accord- ingly be I harsh decree that compelled tile corporation to register the successful compllainant as a stockholder. The corporation should not be compelled to assume the risk of being sued by the purchaser of the outstanding certificate. Tlhe complainant should be compelled to give a bond of indemnity, or else be content with a personal judgment against the defendant. Thle demands of trade and of the investing public require that the safety of a purchaser of a certificate of stock should be assured, except against attach- ments, execution sales or decrees duly obtained and notilied to tle corporation before the I;ona Jido purchaser received the certificate of stock.
			4(06. &#x0027;lheft of/ccrtlifiatel iiorsdel in blank.&#x0027; -Tllo corporation has a duty to perform as regards certificates of stock which have been stolen from the owner who held them indorsed in blank.
			If the owner notified the corporation of tile theft it must refuse to register a transfer to a purchaser of such stolen certificate. Since the owner&#x0027;s negligence may have estopped him from reclaim- ing the stock, tlhe corporation may refuse to recognize either party as a stockholder, where there is a reasonable question of negli- gence, and when sued by either may interplead. If the corpora- tion allowed :a registry before it wvas notified of the theft, it is dif- ficult to see on what principle it is to be held liable to the owner. Such a case scems not yet to have arisen. If notified of the theft before anything is learned concerning the whereabouts of the cer- tificate, the case is to be treated the same as when the certilicate is alleged to have been lost.
			§ 407. Inter)pleader by the corlporation.2-&#x0027;-Whenever there are two or more conflicting claims made to stock, and demands are made on the corporation to allow registry, it is the privilege of the corporation, if there is a reasonable legal doubt as to the rights of the parties, to refuse to register either party, and, when sued by one, to interplead and compel the parties to contest the matter be- tween themselves in the courts. The law does not oblige the cor- poration to turn itself into a court of justice and decide the rights of the parties. The corporation, however, cannot interplead if it has already committed itself by registering one of the claimants as the stocklolder. Nor can the corporation resort to an interpleader where one of the claimants is clearly wrong. The right of inter- pleader and the power of the corporation to refuse to register a transfer until compelled to do so by the courts, where an outstand-

			ing certificate is not surrendered, constitute tie two most effective safeguards of the corporation in allowing or refusing registry.
			§ 4&#x003E;8. Rteslrictiotns by corporation. on stloli;ol(levr&#x0027;s ri.qht to sell or trL.sJfr.l--Tlio law lins uniformly andl decisively discountenanced and overruled all attempts of a corporation to prevent the sale and transfer of its stock by the stockholder. Such attempted re- strictions are generally made by means of by-laws. Thus, a by-law requiring the consent of the directors or other corporate olllcers to a transfer, or a by-law requiring the stockholder, whon lie sells, to sell his stock to specified persons, is null and void. llestrictions nmay be created by a contract mutually agreed to by the stock- holders, but cannot bo imposed upon them by the majority of the stockholders nor by the board of directors. When, however, such restrictions are created by tile charter, they are valid, since they risr, with the corporation and stock itself. Thus, in England, the charter frequently authorizes the directors to refuse a registry un- less the transferee is satisfactory to them. Even here, however, tle directors must be reasonable in the use of their discretion. In this country the most frequent restriction created by charter is that of a lien for debts due to the corporation from the transferror.
			§ 409. Lien o&#x0027; the corporation.-- The charters of many corpora- tions contain an express provision that the corporation may refuse to allow a stockholder to register a transfer of his stock until lie has paid any and all debts which lie may at that time owe to the corporation. Such a lien need not be stated in the certificate of stock. While it may not be created generally by a by-law, yet certain phrases in charters have been held to uphold a lien that is declared and made effectual by a by-law. Where the lien exists tle corporation may refuse to allow a registry of transfer of any stock owned by the debtor until all debts dlue from him to the cor- poration are paid, whether due or not due, including, it seems, un- paid subscriptions. It does not apply, however, to debts due from a transferee of the certificate who never obtained registry or ap- peared as a stockholder on the corporate books. Nor does it apply to debts duo from the registered stockholder, but incurred after the corporation was given notice that he had sold his stock to another. The corporation may waive its lien and allow registry without the debts of the old stockholder being paid. A registry without re- quiring payment is a waiver in itself.

			torney blink, tile corporaotion imay require the names of the trans- seree and of the attorney to he Illled in before it allows a registry. If it is in doubt as to the genuineness of the signature of the former owner of tle certilicate, it may require his presence or reasonable proof that he actually made the signature. It cannot compel the transferrer to be present, but may require the presence of the at- tornoy authori/.ed to make the registry. The registry itself is gen- erally made by a corporate oillcer as attorney. A surrender of tle old cortillfcat is required, and now certificates in tile namne of the transferee are issued. Tlhe by-laws may prescribe tlat thie registry shall be in the presence of certain corporate ollicers. If tho corpo- ration does not keep a transfer book or stock book, a surrender of the old cortilicato and the issue of a noe one is sulicient to con- stitute a transfer antd registry. The applicant may inquire of the corporate olllcer in chlarg for the registry clerk, and is not bound to ascertain tile individual himself. Tlhe corporate registry may be on its ledger without any issue of certilicato. 11 it keeps no regisLiy at all, ilere notice to it of a transfer constitutes a legal registry. Tlle corporation has no right to delay registry unreason- ably for the purpose of obtaining advice or for any other reasons. It may require that the power of attorney run directly from the former registered stockholder and not from an intermediate one. A written acceptance of the stock by the transferee cannot be in- sisted on by the corporation. The formalities of registry may be waived by the corporation, and any act which indicates that it considers a transferee to be a stockholder is effectual to make him such so far as the corporation is concerned, though no registry was had.
			Either the transferrer or the transferee or an intermediate un- registered transferee may apply to the corporation for the purpose of obtaining a registry. The corporation cannot refuse it merely because of tle motive of the transferrer or of the transferee in making the sale and transfer. Whenever the corporation refuses to allow a registry the applicant may sue it for damages, or he may go into a court of equity and ask that the corporation be de- creed to allow registry or to pay damages in lieu thereof. A few cases hold that he may compel registry by a nmadl(lamue against the corporation, but the weight of authority holds otherwise. In the notes below are given the rules of a great railroad corporation on this subject,&#x0027; and it will be noticed that particular attention is i1. Give the name of the transferee 3. Prefixes and affixes, such as Judge, in full, without abbreviation of any Major, Hon., Rev., Doctor, M. D., LL.D., kind. should not be used. 2. If tle transferee be a woman, give 4.

			generally,&#x0027; certificates of deposit, interest coupons, and bonds of corporations.2 Bills of lading havo only a quasi-negotiability.3 Thres different instruments, however, are not necessarily negoti- able, but areso only when in writing; when containing an uncondi- tional promise or order to pay; when the payment is to be in money only; when the amount is certain; when it is payable to a specific person, and not in the alternative; when it is payable at a certain time; when it contains words such as " to A. or order," or " to hcarer," or their equivalent; and when delivery has been duly made. If the instrument is lacking in any one of these qualities, it falls back into the category of non-negotiable -that, is merely assignable- instruments. Again, a holler of one of the above-named negotiable instruments can have the benefit of its negotiability only when lie has purchased it in good faith, for value, before the instrument was due, and without notice of the equitable rights of previous holders or makers; that is, le must be a bona fide holder.4 When all these elements of negotiability and ownership co-exist, the advantage of negotiability over non-negotiability is this: that tlhe holder of the instrument is entitled to the face value thereof, and his right can- not be affected, decreased, or defeated by any facts or equities btween previous holders which would tdefeat the security as between them, unless it be void for usury or other original cause.

Moreover, it Ias been relpeatedly decided by tile courts that a cortificate of stock is not negotitble, and no custom of trado or of brokers can give to it that character, Nevertholess tlhe New York court of appeals has well said that while certificates of stock are not negotiable in form and reprosent no debt and are not so- curities for money, yet "the courts of this country, in view of the extensive dealing in certificates of shares in corporate enterprises, and the interest, both of tle public and of tle corporation which issues them, in making them readily transferable and convertible, have given to them some of the elements of negotiability." l Bank, 57 Ind. 198, 208 (1877), says: "Tlho Homo Lumber Co., 118 Mo. 447 (1803). dillerence between a promissory note In a recent case in Maryland an im- and a certificate of bank stock is so portint distinction is drawn between wido and marked that a rule of law the rights of a bon fide purchaser and governing the transfer of the former is a bona fide pledgee.

			In England an entirely different rule prevails. Cortificates of stock in that country are melrely evidences of ownership of stock, iandl this muniment of title is not negotiable nor quasi-negotiable. Tile purchaser of it is not protected against equities involved in the title of prior owners of the certillcate. Only a transfer on the corporato books shuts off those equities. Inldedo, this rule is in- sisted upon in England so rigidly that not oven the certillcates of stock issued by American corporations and hold by Englishmlen ire given thoe (uasi-nogotiability of the Amcrican law.&#x0027; within the state of New York, an at- tachmlnlot may be levied upon them nnd the interest of the owner or pleldgor thlrein sold, such certillcates being a property right within the state. Silpson v. Jersey City, etc. Co., 105 N. Y. 193 (1000), the court distinguishing thie case of Plilipton t. Bigolow. 93 N. Y. 5i92 (1883), on the ground that the certificates of stock in that case were not within the state. The court said: Certificates of stock are treated by business en as property forall practical purposes. Tlloy are sold in tihe mar- ket and they are transferred as collat- cral security for loans, and they are used in various ways as property. They pass by delivery from hand to hand and they are the subject of larceny." In Masury v. Arkansas National Bank, 93 Fed. Rep. 003 (1899), the court said: " It is a well known fact that stOck cer- tificates frequently circulate in places far remote from the home of the corpo- ration by which they were issued, that in all commercial centers they are coin- monly transferred from hand to hand like negotiable paper, and that they are hypothecated for temporary loans by a simple indorsement and delivery thereof, the latter being perhaps the most con mon use to which such securi- ties are put. In the great majority of cases when stock is merely pledged for a loan, no record of the transfer is made on the books of the corporation, and in the judgment of laymen the making of such a record seems to be a needless formality. The trend of modern de- cisions has been to encourage the free
			8! circulation of stock certificates in the mode last indicated, on the theory that they are a valuable aid to commercial transactions, and that the public inter- est is best subserved by removing all restrictions against their circulation, and by placing them as nearly as pos. sible on the plane of commercial paper." Where no certificatesof stock have been issued, a purchaser of a subscriber&#x0027;s right to the stock is not protected as a purchaser of a certificate of stock is protected. Manchester St. Ry. v, Will. iams. 53 Atl. Rep. 401 (N. H. 1902). See also § 874, bsupra. IThle English courts refuse to follow the American rule in regard to the prac. tical negotiability of certificates of stock transferred in blank, although such certificates of stock are issued by an American corporation. Hence where the English owner of such cer- tificates delivered them toa broker to forward to America for a transfer, and the broker fraudulently sold them for his own purposes to other persons, it was held that no title was conveyed to such other persons, and that the Ameri. can law did not apply. The court said, however, that there was sufficient in the case to put the purchasing party upon notice. Colonial Bank v. Cady, L. R. 15 App. Cas. 2(7 (1890); Williams v. Colonial Bank, L R. 38 Ch.

Ex !turt Sargent, L. R. 17 Eq. 273 (1874); Re Barnod&#x0027;s Banking Co., L. IL 3 Ch. App. 105 (1807). But this is generally not the case. Ortigosa v. Brown, 47 L J.

Even in England, if a broker transfers stock in breach of trust to a bank, and the bank after- wards, at his request, transfers the stock to another person, the bank being ignorant of his agency, is not liable to the principal for the value of the stock. Marshall v. National, etc. Bank, 66 L T. Rep. 525 (1892). As between the trus- tee in bankruptcy of a defaulter and the party to whom the defaulter has transferred shares of stock without a transfer on the corporate books, the lat- ter is entitled to the stock. Re Dodds, 64 L T. Rep. 470 (1891), In Moore v. Northwestern Bank, [1891] 2 Ch. 599, the rules of the company provided that, when certificates were sent in for trans- ser. the particulars should be entered in a book which must be brought before the directors for approval and be signed

			by three members of the board, after whiolh tle registry of transfer was coml- pleted. The real owner of tile cortill cates was permittedl to roelaitl theml before approval by the directors, tlh court saying that tho notice thus givenl to the colmpany gave the court seisin for purposes of adjudication. In Sli. IilOlIn v. London J. S. Ban.l [18911 1 Cl. 270, the court held that a bank to whom a broker had pledged stocks belonging to his custoiler was not a bont Jiule pur- chasor under the facts in that case, and consequently was not protected, even though a bon0a Jide purchaser might have been. Although in England an unregistered transferee of stock is not protected against another transfer which is registered, yet lie is protected wiere lie lodged his transfer with the corporate secretary, and the latter ac- cepted it for transfer before the second transfer was made. Nanney v. Morgan, L R. 85 Ch. D. 508 (1887). In the case of Donaldson v. Gillot, L RI 3 Eq. 274 (1800), the pledgee of one who held the certificate indorsed to himself was not protected, since the pledger had pur- chased as agent and had fraudulently taken title in his own name. This would not be good law in this country, where the failure to have the transfer registered has no effect on the pledgee&#x0027;s rights under such circumstances 1 Daniel. Neg. lusts, . 1708, says: "The phrase &#x0027;quasi-negotiable&#x0027; has been termed an unhappy one, and cer- tainly it is far from satisfactory, as it conveys no accurate, well-defined meaning. But still it describes better than any other short-hand expression the nature of those instruments which, while not negotiable in the sense of the law merchant, are so framed and so dealt with as frequently to convey as good a title to the transferee as if they were negotiable," § 113.]

			stocks to be toll that certificates of stock havo a quasi-negotiability. This term has been coined to describe the character of certain things which can be understood only by a study and knowledge of the characteristics of the thing described. Espeooially is this true of certillcates of stock. Tho information sought is not whether the certificate is quasi-negotiable, but whether tle holder of it is pro- tected under diffcrent states of fact andl circumstances. Ioe who intends to purchase such certificates wishes to know what dangers or risks he incurs by the purchase. The practitioner is interested, not in tlhe general character of the instrument, but in the law as applicable to his particular case. Many of the cases concede to certilicates of stock a quasi-negotiability; but it is extremely doubt- ful whether such discussions do not confuse any understanding of the character of such an instrument more than they explain it.
			§ 414. i&#x0027;To (dlistinction beticee the " legal" and the " qcitable" title inv the trans/fr of certificates o.f stock is tusatisfietory.-- Iany of the cases involving the rights of a transferee of stock discuss and treat the subject fromi the point of view that the transferee is pro- tceted in his ownership when the legal title passes to him, but is not so protected when only the equitable title passes. Unfortu- nately it happens that, under the same state of facts, one court will hold that only the equitable title passes; another that the legal title passes; and a third court will hold that both the legal and the cquitable titles pass. The result is confusion, doubt, and dif- ficulty, with little light as to the real status of certificates of stock.&#x0027;
			" In reaching this conclusion we have not thought it necessary to consider tho supposed distinction between the legal and the equitable title, or to de- termine whether the title of the execu- tors is the one or the other. The dis- tinction belongs appropriately to thelaw of real estate; and, though it has been extended to personalty, the application with regard thereto has been less ex- tensive; and the distinction itself is lesssignificant. For in many cases-as, for example, in the case of money re- ceived in trust or for the use of an- other-courts of law recognize the equitable as the legal title; and, even where the distinction obtains, the equi- table is regarded as the true owner by courts of equity. Hence, in this state, where the courts exercise both juris- dictions, the question as to the nature of the title sued upon is generally
			8s
			immaterial, or, rather, it is material only to the question of the nature of the action, whether legal or equitable, and to the question of parties." Ash- ton v. Zeila Min. Co., 134 Cal. 408 (1901). Such also seems to be the view taken in Lowell on Transfer of Stock (1884), pp. 104, 105, where the learned author says: "It is often supposed, forexample, that the right of a creditor to seize stock which has been sold before it is transferred upon the books depends on the passing of the legal title; but we shall attempt to prove that the legal title has in reality no effect upon the matter." The same authority shows the confusion resulting from this dis- tinction of the legal from the equitable title in the following note to page 103: " That the legal title passes before the transfer on the books. In the follow- ing cases this is made part of the rutio C11. XXIV.]

			genco on tle part of the ownor, a borniitjtlo purchaser is protected now in almost every instance where lhe would bo protected if he were purchasing a promissory note or other negotiable instrument.l Thus tie New York court of appeals hns recently lield that where certificates of stock issued by a Now Jersey corporation are within tilo state of Now York, an attachment may be levied upon them and the interest of the owner or pledgor therein sold, such cortill- cates being a property right within the state.1 Again, oven though in anticipation of an increase of the capital stock the stockholders agreo aniong themselves to waive their prior right to subscribe for such increased capital stock, yet a bombfide purchaser of a cortili- clte of stock prior to such increase is not bound by such agreement and may clailm hlislpro rata share of tile increased capital stock at par.3 And again, where four shares of stock are transferred to a person by the corporation to qualify him as a director, and hlo agrees to return the same to the corporation when ceasing to be a director, but thereafter and before lie ceases to be a director lie agrees with the indorsers of his note that they shall have the stock as collateral security, they are protected, even though the stock was actually delivered to them after they lad notice of the first agreement, it being shown, however, that they had no notice of such agreement at tile time they became sureties.&#x0027; Where no certificates of stock have been issued, a purchaser of a subscriber&#x0027;s right to the stock is not protected as a purchaser of a certificate of stock is pro- tected.5 l Quoted and approved in Cincinnati, etc. Ry. v.

			B. DANOGItB INOUltlUiD IN P&#x0027;UOIIaABINO STOICK. § 417. Liabilities, rislis, and rights of one who owns or purchases a c(rtlficete o&#x0027;fstook.--It is proposed to state separately and in do- tail the liabilities on the subscription price and by statute incurred by one who owns or purchases a certilicate of stock; also the risks or dangors incurred by a purchase of stock as affclted by the rights of previous holders of that stock; also a few of the rights of an owner or purchaser of a certificate of stock as regards the general incidents appertaining to stockholdership. Those subjects are dis- cussed in full in other parts of this work, and consequently the au- thority for rules laid down herein must be sought for in those parts. Tie purpose here is to state succinctly and in language free from technical phraseology tle position occupied by a bona fido pur- chaser of a certificate of stock.
			§ 418. JLiability on uamid plar valeo, that is, the unp1aid subscrip- tion yrice of the stolc.&#x0027;- In general the purchaser of a certificate of stock is immediately liable on the subscription price of the stock so far as it has not been paid by previous holders of the stock purchased and has not been called by the corporation. The transferrer is bound to pay all calls madle before the transferee purchases. If the transforee does not immediately register his transfer on the corpo- rate books, lie is liable to pay to the transferrer such calls as are made after the transfer and which the corporation compels the latter to pay. The transferee who buys stock supposing it to be full paid is not liable for uncalled and unpaid parts of the subscrip- tion, even though the certificate is silent as to whether the par value of the stock has been paid in or not. Especially is this the rule where the certificate states that the stock is paid-up stock, or the transferee, before purchasing, inquires of the corporation and is told that the stock is paid up. Ho may purchase in reliance thereon, and cannot afterwards be held liable, even though the stock turns out not to have been fully paid up.
			§ 419. Forfeitire for non-payment of calls.2--Where the corpo- ration is given by its charter or by statute the right to forfeit and sell stock for non-payment of the subscription price when called in by the corporation, a notice to the stockholder of the intended forfeiture is always required. This notice, however, is given al- ways to him who appears by the corporate registry to be the stock- holder. Accordingly, a transferee or owner of stock who has not obtained a registry of his transfer on the corporate books is liable to lose his stock by a forfeiture for non-payment of calls, and may lose it without knowledgo of the call or forfeiture, unless he ap- pears on the registry of the corporation as the owner of the stock.

			§ 420. Slatltor i liabilitl.&#x0027; - The liability by statute of a pur- clhaser of certillcates of stock to corporate credlitors, in addition to tlhe subscription price which is treoted of abovo, exists in a gront many eases. In tile first placo this liability may not exist at all against any one, either transferrer or t&#x0027;ransferee. It rarely exists in tlhe cas of railroati corporations, Whore tlhe statutory liability exists, tile liability of a purchaser of stock is as follows: If tlhe trnisfcroo iimmediately registers his transfer on the corporate books, ho becomes at once liable by statute for debts of tile corpo. ration contracted after such registry, andl tle transferrer is not liable thereon. The transferee may or may not be liable on cor- porate debts contracted before be purclhased, according to the words of the statute creating the linability. Tle transferror is lia- ble on corporate debts contracted after lie sold tile stock but be- fore the transfer was registered. In tile latter case the transferrer has recourse to the transferee.
			§ 421. Liability wltere the purcthaser h1as t7th transfer made to a nominal hohler.2 - Where a person purchases stock and takes it in the name of a " dummy," the stock never having been registered in the name of the real owner, the latter is not liable on such stock, according to the English rule. In America a contrary rule pre- vails, and the courts hold him liable on the ground that he is a principal, and as such is liable as an undisclosed principal for the acts of his agent, the "duimmy."
			§ 422. No liability for asscssmcnts aft e r telparate of the stock has bee plaid itn.&#x0027;--ly well-established principles of law stock- holders are liable on their stock only to the extent of the unpaid par value of the stock, unless the statute expressly provides other- wise. Neither the directors, nor all the other stockholders com- bined, in corporate meeting assembled or otherwise, can compel a dissenting stockholder to pay any more money into the .corpora- tion or subject him to further liability on his stock. Nor can the legislature, subsequently to his purchase of the stock, pass a law increasing his liability, unless the power to alter or amend the charter is reserved to it, in which case such a law would be con- stitutional.
			§ 423. Liability when stock w as issued.for property.&#x0027;- Shares of stock may be issued under an agreement that payment is to be made in labor, services, material, or contract work. If so issued, and the labor or material received by the corporation is fairly equal in value to the par value of the stock, both the original holder and the transferee of such stock take it as full-paid stock, and 1 See ch.

			cannot be hold liable for any furthor amount, oven thougl the value of the property turns out subsequently to have boen ovoresti. mated but was made in good faith. Wllor, however, the property is intentionally overvalued and stock is issued for it, the persons originally receiving the stock are liablo to have the transaction set aside, the value of the property or work done credited to thoml, and the roal value of the stock, not necessarily the par value, charged to themn, or be compolled to return the stock. As to the trans- forces the case may be dilrcrent. If they purchased with notice of the fraud they are not protected; but if they purchased without notice or knowledge that the property was intentionally overvalued, but supposed that the stock was issued as paid up by payment in property or work taken at a boinjf(le value, or if they have no knowlodge of how the stockl was paid for, but take it as paid.up stock, they may retain the stock, and are not liable for any further amount thereon.
			§ 424. Liability as l)rtlers bl reason of d(fecctie ilncoloratio,&#x0026; or,/or other reasons. --Whore a supposed corporation has not been duly incorporated, or where a corporation for that business is not provided for, the supposed corporation has been hold to be but a partnership, and all the stockholders hold liable as partners. But a failure to file the articles of association, or to sign and publish thellm, or the omission from them of any of the essential facts required to be stated, doeo not ordinarily defeat the attempted incorporation and render the stockholders liable as partners. Again, the stockholders are, in some jurisdictions, liable to be held to be partners, as regards creditors of the enterprise, where the corporation organizes in one place and proceeds to do all its busi- ness in another place. In most such cases, however, the corpora- tion has been recognized and upheld, and the stockholders pro- tected in their limited liability. The latter class of decisions is the stronger, and certainly more to be commended and followed. In any case a transferee is not liable for all precedent debts of the concern, but only for those incurred subsequently to the registry of his transfer.
			§ 425. Danger of corlorate lien.2- Frequently corporations are given by charter or statute a lien on a stockholder&#x0027;s stock for debts due from him to the corporation. When such lien exists, a pur- chaser of the certificate in open market buys subject to the risk that the one from whom he buys owes the corporation a debt, and that the corporation will not allow the transferee of the certilicate to obtain a registry until such debt is paid. In many of the states the lien of the corporation cannot be created by by-law. Generally

			it exists by reason of a provision of tile charter. When it does le- gally exist it extends to all debts owed by tlhe lst registered stock. holder, whether tle debt be duo or not due, and includes unealled parts of the subscription price of the stock. It does not, however, alpply to debts duo from one who has bought and sold tle cortill- cate without appearing on the registry as a stockholdeor. The cor- poration may waive the lion, and a registry without insisting on the lien is such a waiver. The lien of tle corporation extends to debts incurred by the transferror after the transfer, but before the corporation is notified thereof.
			§ 412(. Orcrissitcd stock.&#x0027;-T le capital stock of a corporation is fixed by statute. There is no power in the corporation itself to increase that amount. It can be (lone only by a legislative enact- mont. Accordingly, if the corporation issues certificates of stock when the whlole capital stock has already been issued, the new is- sue, if an equivalent amount of outstanding certificates is not sur- rendered, is an overissue, and is void. Any issue of stock in excess of the amount of the capital stock as fixed by the charter is null and void. The purchaser of such certificates, however, is not with- out his remedy. Ilis certificate is so much waste paper, and he is not a stockholder; but he may sue the corporation for damnages, and recover to the extent of his injury. The purchaser may also sue the corporate officers who participated in the issue of the spuri- ous stock, and may recover damages. lie cannot, however, hold an innocent transferrer liable. The latter, if he knew nothing of the overissue, is not to be held as a guarantor of the validity of the stock which he sells.
			§ 427. Danger that transferrer or lprevious tolder is an infant, married woma{n, or ltunatic.2- A purchase of stock from an infant is a dangerous investment. When the infant comes of age he may elect to disaffirm, and may hold the transferee liable for the stock. There is less danger, however, in accepting a transfer of stock from an infant who has previously purchased the stock which he sells. This previous purchase, and also his sale of the stock, are technically voidable acts; but after the stock has passed from his control the law disregards the doubtful medium of title, and considers the pur- chaser from the infant as the legal stockholder. As regards mar- ried women, the common law allowed the husband to sell her stock after he had reduced it to possession by registering it in his own name on the corporate books. In modern times, however, the right of a married woman to hold and convey personal property as though un..arricd has. been stablished in most states. y statute. er right to sell shares of stock owned by herself exists where she may 1 See oh.

			soil other personal property similarly owned, and this right depends upon tho law and statutes of her domicile. A purchase of stock from a lunatic is void.
			§ 428. Purcltisv of stock by or from a corporation.&#x0027;-In England a corporation cannot purchase shares of its own capital stock. In this country there is a diffeoronc of opinion as to the law. Tlh statutes governing thoe corporation, however, sometimes prohibit such purchases. Such is the case with national banks. In any case, however, whether the corporation purchased the stock legally or illegally, a purchaser of the same stool from the corporation itself is not affected by the invalidity of the title of the corporation. Again, it is a general rule, both in England and America, that one corporation has no right to purchase stock in another corporation. Sometimes the statutes allow such purchases, but more often ex- pressly provide to the contrary by prohibiting them. Novertllo less, whatever rule applies to a purchase by a corporation of stock in another corporation, the law is very clear that a purchaser of such stool from the corporation is protected in his purchase. The unauthorized act of the corporation in purchasing has no effect upon the legality of its sale of the stock.
			§ 429. Purclase from joint ownlers, partners, and agents.2- One joint owner cannot sell stock standing in the name of two or more as joint owners. One partner may sell and convey stock standing in the partnership name. As regards purchases of stock from agents, greater dilficulty occurs. If the purchaser does not know that the vendor is selling as an agent, but supposes lie is buying stock owned by the person with whom he is dealing, the purchaser is always protected. The same rule, after considerable doubt and discussion, has been established, even though the purchaser knows that the agent is selling as agent. The sale is valid, and the pur- chaser is protected, provided he has no reason to suspect that the agent is selling in fraud of the owner&#x0027;s rights or in contradiction of his orders.
			§ 430. Purchase of stock at sheriff&#x0027;s execution sale, or from as- signee in bantkrtuptcy, or for benefit of creditors.3- A purchase of stock at an execution sale by the sheriff is a dangerous investment. Almost always the judgment debtor has already sold and transferred his certificates of stock to a bona Jfie purchaser. If such bonafitle purchaser has registered the transfer on the corporate books before the attachment or execution is levied, the purchaser at the execu- tion sale gets nothing. If no such registry has been made, but the judgment debtor sold and transferred the certificate before the levy of attachment or execution, in most of the states, including New

			York, such a purchaser takes title and the execution purchaser none. In Connecticut anl a few other states a contrary rule prevails. If, however, the judgment debtor soils tile certificato after tho attach- mlint or execution is levied, tlh purchaser takes no title - tho ex- ecution purchaser is entitled to the stock. A purchaser of stock from an assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency, or for the benelltof creditors, takes a good title if ho obtains the certificates of stock. If, however, the insolvent has sold such certiflcates to another, the latter is entitled to the stock.
			4:31. Purch ase from a plc!le o.-- A pledgee of stock has no right to sell or ropledge the stock held as collateral by him, unless the pledger agreed that he might do so. If, however, the pledgee sells or repledges the stock to one who takes it in good faith, for value, and without notice of tle fact that lie is dealing with a pledgee of the stock, such a bona uile purchaser is protected. lie is protected absolutely, and can keep tle stock if he purchased it. If, however, he merely took it in pledge from the pledgee, le is obliged to give up the stock to the real owner, where the latter tenders to the re- pledgee the amount of the debt owed by the pledgee to the ropledgeo, for wliich the stock was given as security. Where, how- ever, a person buys or tales in pledge stock from one who makes known the fact that he is holding tle stock as pledgee, the former is not a bonaftide purchaser. Moreover, he is not a bonafide holder where lie would not be a boluafidc holder of a promissory note transferred under similar circumstances, as, for instance, where he loans the money at an usurious rate of interest; or where he knows that the person with whom he is dealing is but an agent, and is pledging his principal&#x0027;s stock. In all these cases, where the pur- chaser or pledgee of stock is not a bonajfide holder, the real owner and original pledgor of the stock may reclaim his stock from the repledgee, or purchaser from the pledgee, where tli original pledgor could recover it from the first pledgee. The repledgee or purchaser from the pledgee in such a case stands in the shoes of the first pledgee, and has no better rights than the latter.
			§ 432. Pledogee is protected in the same way as purchaser of stock.2 The rules contained in this chapter explain the rights, dangers, and liabilities incurred by the purchaser of stock. The same rules pre- vail for the most part in favor of one who receives stock in pledge. A purchaser and a pledgee are treated in the cases as being simi- larly protected or similarly not protected. There is, however, one important exception to this rule. If a person who is about to take stock from nnother iknows that the latter is disposing of the stock

			as an agent, the formor mniy purchase the stocl; and be protected, but cannot take it in pledge and be similarly protected. An agent to soil is not an agent to plelge. Another exception to the simi- larity ol&#x0027; position of tho vondole and pledgee of stock is that by statute, frequently, tile latter is not liable on stock whore the former is liable.
			§ 433. )Dan!er of limr1cas7imi from an exctuetor, administrator, or lfmtirdiam.-&#x0027; There is practically little danger incurred in purohas- ing stock from any one of these. It is the duty un(l right of the executors or administrators to sell the personal property and convert it into money. As regards guardians, they have the right to change the funds fromn one investment to another, unless a statute pro- scribes otherwise. Accordingly, a purchaser of stock from any one of tiloso is protected in his purchalse, even though le knows that his vendor is selling in his olllcial capacity. If, however, the venlee knows that a breach of trust is involved or contemplated, lie is not a bona fJidt purchaser and is not protected. All the ex- ecutors or administrators need not join in a sale of the stoolc owned by the estate. A sale and transfer by one is sulliciont.
			, 434. Plrclask( from a trlstee."-c. An entirely dillerent rule pre- vails as regards stocl; held by a trustee as trustee. A purchaser of stock which he knows the vendor holds as belonging to a trust es- tate is bound to ascertain whether, by the instrument creating the trust, the trustee has a power to sell. If he has no such power, and the vendoe knows that lie is buying trust-estate stock, the latter is not protected, but is a party to any breach of trust that may be involved by the sale. If, however, the purchaser has no notice or knowledge that his vendor is selling trust stock, the former is a bona Jidle purchaser to that extent. lie is not bound to know that the stock is trust-estate stock, and consequently he is protected in his purchase. Any facts that would put an ordinarily intelligent man on inquiry as to whether the stock belongs to a trust estate is notice, and prevents the purchaser from claiming to be a bona fido purchaser. Thus, such a notice is held to be given by the fact that on the face of the certificate of stock, and following the name of the stockholder, the word "trustee" or equivalent words are writ- ten.
			§ 435. Sale by rendor to another lptrcthaser without delicery of certificate of stock.-- A purchaser of certificates of stock has no reason to fear that the vendor can sell the stock to another person and thereby defeat the rights of the purchaser with the certificates. If the purchaser without certificates does not obtain registry on the corporate books, he obtains nothing as against a bonaide pur- &#x0027;See ch. XIX, supra.

			chalser of the certificates, even though tho. latter&#x0027;s transaction was subsequent in time to the former. If, however, the former obtains registry on the corporate books, the corporation is at fault, and is liable to the purchaser with the certificates. The corporation must either issue now certillcatcs to the latter or pay damages.
			.18(3. )Dan,/er o/l&#x0027;fo.qcry!l.&#x0027;-Forgery cannot be the source of a good title to any chose in action, whether a promissory note, bond and mlortgage, or a certillcato of stock. Consequently a purchaser of stock takes the risk that some previous ownerof the stock, whoso name appoars on the certilicate either as the registered owner or as transferee, was deprived of his title by forgery. If the forgery has been made, the purchaser cannot claim or hold tle stock, al- though lie had no actual knowledge of the forgery. lie, however, hals recourse to his vendor, and may compel him to repay the amount paid for tle stock. Where, however, the forgery was com- mitted prior to tle last regi.teed transfer of that stock, a bonafdla pu&#x0027;rchaser from or subsequent to the last reimisered holder of that stock is protected. All rights and equities to particular shares of stock are cut oil by a registry and sale of the new certilicates. Tle party whose namue was forged lias recourse then only to tle corpo- ration, or to tle party obtaining registry, or to previous holders. This limitation to the dangers incident to the purchase of stock extends to other rights and wrongs as well as to a case of for- ger), and is of great importance in protecting a boi)bade purchaser of stock.
			§ 437. Loss or theft of certificatesi indorsed in blanlc..- It is ex- tremely doubtful lhetlher a purchaser of a certilicate of stock which was indorsed in blank, and which has been lost by the owner and found by another whlo sells it, or which has been stolen by the lat- ter, would be protected in his purchase, even though he buys in good faith. In a case of negotiable paper, such a purchaser would, of course, be protected. But probably the purchaser of the certifi. cate of stock would not be. No case holds that he would be pro- tected, while many hold that he would not. If the real owner was guilty of gross negligence, perl;aps the purchaser from the thief or linder of the certificate indorsed in blank would be protected. In one case this question of negligence was submittted to the jury. Again, sometimes a person sells stock without delivering the cer- tificate, the vendor telling the vendee that the certificates have been lost. Such a title is very precarious. The purchaser should refuse to buy until new certificates are issued by the corporation to the vendor,- an issue which the corporation will make upon a suitable bond of indemnity being given to it by the person who alleges a

			loss. If the purchaser does not take this precaution he buys sub- ject to having his title defeated by another purchaser who obtained the certificates which are alleged to have boon lost.
			§ 488. Danger that a previous holdeor bas been deprived of that stame stock by frafd.&#x0027;- Shares of stock are the smno as other kinds of property, in that a person who has been deprived of his stock by fraud cannot follow the stock and tako it from tle hands of a bona filod purchaser for value. Tle remedy of the defrauded person is for damages against the person defrauding him, or for a retransfer of the stock, if the latter still holds it, together with an injunction against the transfer of the latter. But if the person obtaining the stock by fraud sells it, even in violation of an injunction, the bona fide purchaser for value and without notice is protected. The de- frauded party may, however, sue the person defrauding him in the state of the corporation, and, by an attachment or execution, obtain the stock if it has not passed into bonafile hands. Such a danger, however, is the ordinary danger of an attachment or execution. A li )sp1tenes of a suit involving stock never charges the vendor of the stock with notice, as is the case of a lispendena affecting real es- tate. Cases of fraud in the sale of stock frequently arise in cases of sales by agents and an appropriation of the proceeds; also when fraudulent representations are made to the vendor.
			§ 439. Statlitt of fratuds.&#x0027;- The statute of frauds requires that sales of personal property exceeding in value a certain amount, generally fifty dollars, shall be valid and enforceable only when the property is partly or wholly delivered, or partly or wholly paid for at the time of the sale, or the terms of the sale are reduced to writing. In this country a sale of stock must conform to this stat- ute. Generally the sale is made by a delivery of the certificate in- dorsed in blank. Such a sale constitutes a delivery, and is legal, and is not void by the statute of frauds. The statute applies both to sales of stock which are considered as completed and to sales which are to be-completed in the future.
			§ 440. Gambling sales of stock.2- A gambling sale or contract to sell stock is void absolutely, and cannot be enforced. As a matter of practical experience, however, it is difficult to prove that a stock sale is a gambling sale. It is such only when both the vendor and vendee intend, not to actually have a delivery of the stock, but to wait and see whether the stock rises or falls in the market, and then to settle the contract by the loser paying the loss. An intent by one of the parties that there shall be no delivery will not iauke the sale a gambling one. It must be the intent of both.

			§ 441. Jfcethlld of assigntig,. a cert(iscate of stock.&#x0027;--A certificato of stocl is generally assigned by the owners signing the blank transfer and power of attorney on tle back of the certificate. Tho transfor gives title to him whoso name is afterwards filled into tho blank transfer thus signed. The blank power of attorney is for an entirely dilrorent purpose. It enables the person whoso name is filled in to register the transfereo as a. stockholder in the corporate books. Generally the power of attorney is filled in with the name of a clerk or agent of the transferee, or a clerk of the corporation who has charge of the registry books. After the registered holder has signed the transfer, leaving the transferee&#x0027;s nanoe in blank, the certificate passes from hand to hand until some holder cares to fill his name into the blank. lie may then obtain registry, or he may execute another transfer and sell the certilicate. Transfers need not be under seal in this country. In England, by statute, they generally are required so to be.
			§ 442. Ice!istry of tra(nsfer.&#x0027;-A registry of transfer is made by surrendering an old certificate of stock to the corporation, mak- ing an entry of the transfer on the corporate registry and taking fronm the corporation a new certilicate issued in the name of the transferee. The object of obtaining the registry is to obtain a right to vote, to receive dividends, and various other incidental stockholders&#x0027; rights; also to cut off corporate lions and the rights of third parties who may attach or claim the stock. If there is a reasonable legal doubt as to the right of the applicant to obtain registry, the corporation may refuse it, and thus obtain the protec- tion of being compelled to make it by legal proceedings. If two parties claim the stock, each denying the right of the other, the corporation may interplead, provided there is a reasonable legal doubt as to who is entitled to the stock. If the corporation im- properly refuses to register a transfer when requested, the applicant may have his remedy in damages, but in most states cannot have a m an(laa ?us.
			§ 443. Prc7haser not affected by rightts of holders of that stock back of the last re!istry.--This rule is peculiar to stock certifi- cates, and cuts off rights even of a former owner who has been de- prived of the stock by forgery. The person who obtains a registry first, after the illegal act has been done, is not protected by this rule. But his bona file purchaser of the new certificates and all subsequent purchasers are protected, and cannot be compelled to give up the stock to the prior owner who was deprived of it illegally.
			§ 444. Summallry.- It will be seen by a review of the sections of this chapter, that the dangers of loss incurred by the purchase of a

			certificate of stock are not serious or numerous; and it is well that suoch is the result. Porlhaps the imost striking industrial feature of modern times is the accumulation of personal property, and the in- vestment of that property, not in landed estates, but in the stocks and bonds of corporations. Suol investments are made not alone by capitalists, but by thousands whose savings have no other satis- factory mode of disposition. In fact, it is curious to note how the (lillorent kinds of property have a different relative importance in the course of time. Five hundred years ago real estate was the only property that brought wealth and standing to its owner. Per- sonal property was of little consequenco, and not much of it was in existence. But during the past two hundred years personal prop- erty has risen to the ascendency. The banker, merchant, manu- facturor, and capitalist have become wealthier than the land-owner. The banker millionaire is greater and more powerful than the no- bility. Land, the old source of centralized wealth, inordinate power, caste privileges and hereditary. rights, no longer maintains its pre- eminent importance.
			And it is not alone the capitalist and banker that purchases and holds stock in corporations. The surplus wealth of the people at large is being invested in corporate stocks and bonds. Consolida- tions of railroad and manufacturing institutions are taking place on a colossal scale, and each consolidation involves the issue of new securities. A single company, The United States Steel Corpora- tion, has issued bonds and stock aggregating over one and a half billions of dollars. The great railroad systems are annually in- creasing their capitalization. Street railways, gas companies, elec- tric-light companies and water-works companies are continually adding to the list of these securities. In the course of time all these securities pass into the hands of investors, boniafde holders. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the law governing stocks and bonds, in the magnitude of the interests, the number of persons affected, and the variety of legal principles involved, is more important than all other branches of law combined. Even real estate, so far as the cities are concerned, is being absorbed by corporations, which issue stock to represent it. In the great mon- eyed centres stock constitutes the chief basis of credit, as collateral for loans at banks and trust companies. Hundreds of millions of dollars are loaned with no other security than certificates of stock transferred in blank with no registry whatsoever on the corporate books. Hence it is with reason that the constant tendency of the courts is to protect the bonafide purchasers of certificates of stock. It is fitting, in these days of the formative period of the law gov- erning corporations and stock, that the principles governing the transfer of certificates should favor the protection and security of

			the investing public, and should bo anginst secret lions, attaoh- monts, olaiilms, and nogligonoo of both tho corporation and third persons. T&#x0027;he circuit court of appeals of the United States has well said: "In the groat imajority of cases whon stook is morely plodged for a loan, no record of the transfer is madei on tho books of the corporation, and in the judgment of laynion tho making of suoll a record seems to bo a needless formality. The trend of molorn de- cisions has been to encourage the free circulation of stook certilicates in the mode last indicated, on the theory that they are a valuablo aid to commercial transaotions, and that til public interest is best subserved by removing all restrictions against their ciroulation, and by placing theml as nearly as possible on the piano of oommercial paper."

A stock exchange is a place of business where those who make up the membership of the ex- change buy and sell stocks and bonds. These persons are called stock-brokers. A stock-broker is one who buys and sells stock as the agent of another, the latter being called a customer of the stock-broker.&#x0027; Accordingly, in an ordinary purchase of stock through stock-brokers, there are generally four persons involved - the two brokers and their respective customers. Stock-brokers have a language of their own. They have coined and put into 1 In Sibbald v. Bethlehem Iron Co., 83 says: " The true definition of a broker N. Y. 378 (1881).

An infant is not bound by his con- tracts with or through a stock-broker, any more than lie is bound by Ils other contracts. Moreover, if tlh broker carries on stock transactions for an infant lie is liable to the latter for all moneys lost thereby.0 Again, a broker who sells or buys stock in the name of an infant is himself liable to the other party in case the con- tract is not completed by reason of such infancy.7 On the other land, if the broker&#x0027;s customer hands in the name of a third person, tion andl puroluhsod tlio greater part hliinself.

			§ 452. Diuties and liabilities of a bro7ker tonardls clustomier.-- The broker also owes certain duties and incurs certain liabilities in his relations with his customer. It is said that he cannot sell on credit, since that is not the usual course of his business.2 Ile is liable in damages for failui-3 to buy or sell in accordance with his express orders.3 Where the customer fails to carry out the transaction, but the broker does carry it out at a profit, the profit belongs to the customer.&#x0027; But the customer is not entitled to stock held for him by the broker until he pays the broker all his reasonable disburse.. ments thereon.6 The broker may deposit a margin with the oppo- site broker, according to custom, and not be responsible to his customer if it is lost,6 although the rnle may be otherwise as to a delivery of the stocks themselves.7 The broker is required to exer- cise reasonable diligence and care, and no more.8 lBut he has no suIch lien if he knows that tie customer is acting as agent for an- other.Y It is a question of doubt whether a broker who has re- crived in good ifith commissions from a person guilty of embezzle- Illcnt is lilble to pay over lo tthe persons injured by his customer commiiissions so received.1" W\lro al broker lhas with notice (lea.; &#x0027;54 i1877), the court holil thltt (oI-. 1it4&#x0027;lllf il&#x0027;"iiliitr t wIiII d l iroU lioe to pro. iirt llis lilttlr #titi la i, IosI y Uv li I 0 l ll l ollt )p1 ls tli i ti Il k exillilli gti four li&#x0027;ion1roii) tll&#x0027;l llltl Ji ) I&#x0027;tlllt&#x0027;l4l&#x0027;t, t ihll iii 3 ll , jt h ili&#x0027;ti 1i i ,iit Vllill o110 o&#x0027;| ll) &#x003E;tlll ) l lll.&#x0027;i&#x0027;i* l i&#x0027; lt lll4 iBll4 I ii i n l ll&#x0027;;it y i:l J491l, 341401i1444i I i.4 443 .4ue M 4 l 3li34 i:l0 ,iu &#x0027;4&#x0027; f li) lll1u" i A tIl &#x0027; 411 go |It ll I ll1U IJ (1(l )t1. t I 1isi&#x003C; I tl»&#x0027;;l v |(tgllJ||ll K;, l t; I l:.1 ilif, l.l| I .&#x0027;l. l , It(, l AH7 ) , it 11 &#x0027; . !sis | t|ii , , 6 »pt, fl I&#x0027; N&#x0027; i.» (l1) )&#x0027;ll p )&#x0027;(, ii l,, : cI&#x0027; i 3lti, I lt 111 ill£ i t&#x0027; I (lli 7 11, ilmiin~w 140 &#x0027;1» It)~ 11l.4| 3iP4s. 440; i l i 4ti&#x0027; I j titll J i#I ilt ffIl l it i&#x0027;o P&#x0027;Iili ,,lI444144I* i I441t ;,~ 394 3&#x0027;4 Ill 3 I4t1 , l34 J,,~»!&#x0027;,# l IJs)) 3) t(ll&#x0027; 1| /.&#x0027;.t |&#x0027;t9 I d»i(- t &#x003C;,,&#x0027;!,i l, i, si | )!i, (- ! :t ,,i l!l,&#x0027;I i1 i, s ,~l&#x0027;~ s

At an early day the rule was laid down by the English courts that llo who buys or solls stocl; through a stock-broker must bo considered ns dealing with him according to thl usages of tho market in wlich ho ldeals, and tho customs which prevail in relation to that speoios of business.&#x0027; A lato decision, however, soems to hold that a stock-exchange custom does not bind tlhe customer unless lie knew of it andn agreed to it." The Ameri- can rule allows usages of brokers to interpret tho language of the contract, and where it is obscure to ascertain its nature and extent, but not to vary its torms, introduce new conditions, or authlorizo acts contrary to its provisions.3 The customer may, 1 In Blodermana v.

			§ 455. Privily of contract between the opposite custotmers.--Vhen the broker of one customer has agreed with the broker of another customer on the terms of a purchase and sale of stock, there im- mediately arises a privity of contract between the two customers. A customer may be sued by a dealer from whom his broker has purchased specific stock, and the dealer may sell the stock after no- tice, and recover the loss.4 The purchasing customer is liable to the selling customer for all calls and liabilities arising on the stock after the broker&#x0027;s contract is made, if the selling customer is obliged to pay such liabilities by reason of his being the registered stock- holder.5 So also the purchasing customer may hold the selling cus- tomer responsible for the carrying out of the contract."

Intereninlg sulb-brokers and stb-customers.-Whore a cus- tomor&#x0027;s broker employs another broker to transact the business, the customer cannot compel the second broker to complete tile contract as he might compel the first broker." The second broker cannot claim a lion on the stock for debts due him from the first broker.7 The broker cannot offset against the customer of the sub- broker a debt due the broker from the sub-broker. Not even a custom of the stock exchange to that effect binds the customer un- less he agreed to it.8 If the first broker merely introduces the par- ties he cannot charge a commission therefor, although custom allows it.9 The real customer may hold an intermediate customer liable. A sub-broker or correspondent broker is not obliged to ascertain the relations and agreements between the chief broker and the customer. The sub-broker may hold all stocks as security for all accounts between himself and the chief broker, there being no notice given of the customer&#x0027;s rights. If there is any surplus after the sub-broker&#x0027;s debt is paid, a customer who placed his own stock in the chief broker&#x0027;s hands to sell is preferred to another cus- tomer who had purchased on a margin and left the stock as seen- ritv.1° Where the customer orders his broker to buy stock, and the broker does buy it through a sub-broker, and the broker then n6ti- fies the customer that the stock has been bought, the broker&#x0027;s title 1 Street v.

The subsequent insolvency of the broker does not prevent a customer notifying the sub-broker not to sell out the stook with- out notifying him, the customer; and the customer may insist that the sub-broker resort to other stocks belonging to the broker and remaining in the sub-broker&#x0027;s hands to pay tih broker&#x0027;s debts to the sub-broker before resorting to the above stock.&#x0027; If brokers in Nnv York take orders through a local broker in another place, they are liable for false and fictitious orders given to Lhom by !lim in the name of a customer.2
			§ 457. Purochases or sales on miargins- Broker as a plledleo - Distribution of assets on failure of broker.- By far the larger part of a stock-broker&#x0027;s business consists of purchases and sales of stock on what is called a "margin." The customer deposits with the broker, as security, a slim of money equal to but a small part of the value of the stock involved. This sum of money is t;iL "mar- gin." If the customer&#x0027;s order is to purchase, then the broker keeps both the margin and the purchased stock as security against loss in the final closing of the transaction. If the customer&#x0027;s order is to sell, then the broker sells; but, having no stock to deliver, he borrows the same from other parties and delivers it to the pur- chaser, the broker still keeping the margin as security. Frequently no stock passes, nor is intended to pass, but merely the ultimate profit or loss, called "differences," is paid; the losing customer loses the whole or part of his margin, the winning customer get- ting back his margin and also the profits, less commissions. This in some of the states is held to be a gambling contract, and, like all gambling contracts, not enforceable.&#x0027; -But a purchase or sale of stock on margins, where there is no proof of an intent not to actually deliver the stock, is legal.2 The relation between a cus- tomer and his broker, in cases where the broker buys for his X Le Marohant v.

See § 844, supra. The important case of Hatch v. Douglas, 48 Conn. 116 (1880), clearly sets out the legality of such con- tracts. The court said: "It is pretty evident that the parties did not contem- plate that the stock should be actually transferred to the defendant.. §* 17.]

The brokers " knew that the defendant was speou- lating, and that they advanced him money for that purpose. But that was neither illegal nor immoral. ... No case las been cited which declares such a contract illegal. If we should so hold, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to draw the line between legal and illegal transactions." The California constitution renders void a transaction wherein a broker buys stock for the customer with the broker&#x0027;s money and holds the stock as security and charges the customer interest and commissions.

In fact,the broker is obliged to conform to the rules govern- ing pledges of stock -a subject treated in oh. XXVI, infra. The broker is a pledgee,&#x0027;and without express contract bas a lien on the stock for the balance due under a purchase, but not for any general balance due. Leahy v. Lobdell, etc. Co., 80 Fed.

See Boylan tv Huguet, 8 Nov. 845 (1873). A broker holding as pledgee stock purchased for a customer on margin need not Ictep that identical btcok on hand, and it is sufficient if he keeps an equal quantity on hand over and above stock of the same kind held by him for other cus- tomers Caswell v. Putnam, 120 N. Y. 153 (1800). A broker holding stock as collateral security on a margin does not hold the stock in a fiduciary ca- pacity. lcBurney v. Martin, 6 Rob. (N. Y.) 502 (1866); Lambertson v.

Chase v. City of Boston, 63 N. E. Rep. 1059 (Mass. 1902). In Massa- chusetts it is held that a broker carry. ing stocks on a margin is not a pledgee. Covell v. Loud, 135 Mass. 41 (1883).

			In England a customer, by employing a broker to do business on the stock exchange, is presumed to have authorized him to do business on tile terms of suchl exclango. IHence the broker may have the right to sell his customer&#x0027;s stock upon the customer&#x0027;s failure to pay therefor, without observing the rules applicable to pledgees of stock.&#x0027; In England, also, where certificates of stock have not the quasi-negotiability that they have in America, a mort- gage of stock is comnlon and is enforced as a mortgage. and the mortgagee after a reasonable time may sell without notice to the mortgagor, the law being laid down as follows: "Express powers were not formerly necessary on mortgages of stock, or in the in- struments of defeasance executed by the transferee; nor need a mortgagee of stock now rely on his statutory power in order to realize his security by sale. If stock is itself made the security for money, and the day appointed for payment is passed, the mort- gagee may at once proceed to sell the stock, and repay himself principal and interest, without any authority from the mortgagor, and without commencing an action of foreclosure."2 Some of the most important questions connected with brokers&#x0027; contracts arise out of this pledgee relationship. This subject, however, is fully treated in the following chapter. Like an ordinary pledgee of stock, the broker may have the stock transferred into his own name; he is not allowed to repledge the stock;4 and he can put his customer in default only by tendering the stock and demand- customer has tendered the balance and demanded the stock. If the broker is adjudicated a bankrupt the customer may treat this as a breach of coi-tract and prove his claim. In re Swift, 105 Fed. Rep. 493 (1900). In a bankruptcy court sitting in Massachusetts the rela- tion between a broker and a customer was defined to be that of debtor and creditor. In re Topliff, 114 Fed. Rep. 323 (1902). The relation between a bro- ker and his customer in a purchase of .tock on margin is not that of a pledgee and pledgor, but of parties to an exec- utory contract for the sale and pur- chase of stock, whenever demand and payment is made by the purchaser, or after the broker has tendered the stock and made demand for payment after reasonable notice. The bankruptcy of the broker is a breach of the contract by him. In re Todd, 112 Fed. Rep. 315 (1901).
			&#x0027;Forget v. Baxter, [100] A. G. 467. In England the carrying of stock by a broker on a margin is called "con- tango," and the broker is held to be the owner of the stock. In the case of Ben. tinck v. London, etc. Bank, [1803] 2 Ch. 10. Ihe court said: "In all these trans- actions, therefore, when money is bor- rowed from a stock-broker in this way on &#x0027;contango&#x0027; or continuation, v.hether the money is obtained from hie dealer or from other stock-brokers or from bankers, the result is the same: the arrangement is one by which the broker becomes, as between himself and his client, the owner of the shares in question,&#x0027;although he is under a con- tract to provide an equal amount of similar shares at a futuir date." 2 Devergesv.

A cus- tomer who owns particular certificates ,l stock and pledges them with his broker may reclaim such certificates from the broker&#x0027;s as- sets upon the insolvency of the latter, but eh cannot claim any par- ticular stocks which the broker has purcuhased for him, oven though lie is able to identify them as being tile ones which were purchased for him, inasmuch as his equities are loi bettor than the equities of other customers.4 Where a broker, by custom and authority im- 1 Read v.

Even though a broker repledges the stocks of various customers without authority from them, the pledgee is protected if he had no knowledge of the fact that the broker did not own the stocks; and if the pledgee, after selling out the stocks on notice, has a balance remaining both of money and stocks, the customers prorate as to such bal- ance, even though the stocks of some of them wore not sold by the pledgee. ThiL rule is based on the principle that if they all had united in redeeming from the pledgee they would have borne the loss pro rala. Whitlo-k tv. eaboard Nat. Bank, 20 N. Y. Misc. Rep. 84 (1899). 4 Sillcocks v. Galludet, 60 Hun, 522 (1892). Where the bank in which stock- brokers deposit their funds is a bona fule holder of cash so deposited and also of securities deposited by the brokers as security, and the brokers fail, and the bank applies the cash to the brokers&#x0027; debts and then sells the securities to pay the balance, leaving a surplus, a customer of the brokers whose cash was deposited by the brokers in the bank may reclaim the same, even as against the owners of the securities. Mutton v. Peat, [1000] 2 Ch. 79. The rule that a customer who pays money to a broker to buy stocks or gives him
			securities to sell is a special c&#x0027;idltor does not apply where the customer bought and sold stocks through the broker and kept merely a general ac- count. King v. Hutton, [1000] 2 Q. B. 504. The right of a stock exchange, in accordance with its rules, to apply the assets on the exchlango of an insolvent member to his obligations on the ex- change is not affected by the bank- ruptcy act in England. Re Woodd, 82 L. T. Rep. I50 (1000). Where a broker purchases stock for a customer through another broker and then fails, and the sub-broker sells out all his securities to pay a debt and has a surplus, the cus- tomer may reach such surplus in prefer- enco to other creditors of his broker. In re Graff, 117 Fed. Rep. 343 (1002). Where a broker at the time of his fail. ure has on hand a larger amount of a certain stock than i.e holds for a cus- tomer, the customer may claim that part of such stock is his own. In re Graff, 117 Fed. Rep. 343 (1002). A cred- itor of a defaulter on the stock ex- change who has taken the benefit of tlie private distribution of stock ex- change assets, made by the official as- signee of the stock exchange under its rules, is not precluded fron afterwards taking ordinary legal proceedings for the recovery of his debt, though he must give credit for what he has re- ceived from the official assignee.

			§ 458. .7ro7ccr&#x0027;s rights and duties on, failure of margin.- When the "margin" which the customer deposits with his broker hap- pens to become exhausted by the fluctuations of the market ad- versely to tle customer, dlificult questions arise as to the several rights and duties of the bro!;er and of the customer. If the broker is under orders to close the transaction when the margin becomes exhausted, he of course is obliged to do so.6 But, otherwise, the rule is that the broker cannot summarily close the transaction, even though he has fear of greater loss, involving a loss by himself. He is obliged to demoPnd further margin from his customer, at the same time notifying him that the previous margin is exhausted; also that, in case the margin is not made good, he will close the transaction, holding the customer liable for the loss; also stating the time and place of such threatened sale.6 The notice must be ent brokers, see § 450, supra.

The customer can- not enjoin the broker unless tile latter is insolvent.4 The suit should be at law,5 and demand and tender need not be alleged.&#x0027; A cus- tomer who has notified his broker that a sale was unauthorized does not waive the objection by retaining the account of the sale subsequently sent to him by the broker.7 An illegal sale of the pledge by the pledgee is a conversion, and a complaint for such conversion will not be construed as a complaint for breach of con- tract.8

No doubt the pledgor can redeem upon a tender of the debt, or he may recover the dif- ference between the value of the pledge and the debt.

			violation of the terms of his contract, and thereby makes a profit, the customer has his option either to repudiate the transaction altogether and sue for damages, or he may adopt it and claim for himself the benefit made by his agent.t It has been held that, whore the broker fails to buy according to the instructions of his customer, and the customer suffers a loss by reason of the failure, the object of the purchase being to cover a short sale, the measure of damages is the difference between the price at which the stock was sold short and the market price upon the day when the order was given to the broker to buy in. In other words, the plaintiff may in such a case recover the profits which he would have &#x0027;made had his order been properly executed." And the rule is the same when the loss to the customer results from the failure of the broker to sell as instructed, or where the broker sells at an improper or manifestly unfavorable time.&#x0027; Where a broker agrees to carry tinguishing Austin v.

Rep. 63 (1808), where the broker was authorized to sell at 229 and actually did sell at 221, the court held that the principal could not adopt and enforce the contract, inasmuch as the broker was not authorized to sell at that price, and the contract not binding the prin- cipal when made did not bind the other parties. For the measure of dam- ages where a broker converts his cus- tomer&#x0027;s securities, and then is unable by reason of his insolvency to replace them, see Chamberlain v. Greenleaf, 4 Abb. N.

			stocks to a certain time, but he sells them before that time, the damage is based upon the prices at the time to which ho agreed to carry the stocks.l
			Where a party telegraphs to sell a certain stock, the sale to be "shIrt" and speculative, the damages for failure of the telegraph company to deliver the message are too remote and speculative, even though the stock goes down on the market.2 The question (1880), it appears that the plaintiff pur- oliasod through the agency of the do- fondant a stock option, a privilege known as a "straddle," upon which the defendant guaranteed that the fluc- tuations in the stock during the pend- onoy of the contract should amount to oiglt per cent. On the next day after the purchase defendant sold the stock short, which resulted in a loss to the plaintiff, who had at the time of the purchase authorized defendant, as her agent, to exercise the option. As to the measure of damages the court piid: "An objection is taken to the rule of damages. It is insisted that, as plaintiff never gave any directions to &#x0027; put&#x0027; or &#x0027;call&#x0027; the stock, she should not have recovered as if she had. But in the absence of such directions it was defendant&#x0027;s duty, under the circum- stances of this case, as we have already said, to have closed the &#x0027;straddle&#x0027; con- tract by exercising the option at the most favorable time, and to have acted for her in that respect with reasonable care and skill As he did not do so, she is entitled to recover what she has lost by his neglect; and the price of the stock from day to day during the run- ning of the option having been shown, it was for the jury to determine that amount." Cf. -"eyer v. Colgate. 4 Hun, 022 (1875). Where a broker sold stock for his customer without authority and in violation of an agreement not to sell, and it appeared that for thirty days after notice was given to the customer of the sale the stock could have been purchased in the market for the price at which it was sold or even for less,

			It is a well-settled rule that if a broker, acting in good faith and without default, incurs personal loss or damage in the course of .transacting the business of his agency, or in following the instruc- tions of his principal, lie may recover from the principal full com- pensation therefor.&#x0027; Accordingly, whore a broker buys stock upon I See ~§ 471-473, infra. 2 Minor v.

Rep. 125 (1897), the court held that even though a broker sold his princi- pal&#x0027;s stock, which the broker held as pledgee, prior to the time to which the broker had agreed to carry the stock, yet that the broker might recover from his principal any loss in such sale as compared with the price at which the broker originally bought the stock, but
			that the client could counter-claim for the damage due to the sale being made prior to the agreed time The court held, however, that where by the con- tract the broker was to accept delivery of certain stock at a certain time for his principal, but before that time the broker sold such stock, contrary to his agreement with his principal, the bro- ker could not recover any damages for the loss. &#x0027; Schepeler v.

			at the sale, then the sale is voidable. § 403. Definition of pleldge, mortgage, and lien.- A pledge may be defined to be a delivery of personal property as a security for some debt or engagement. A mortgage of personalty, on the other hand, is a sale with the condition attached that, if the mort- gagor performs some act, the sale shall be void. In a pledge the title remains in the pledgor, and the pledgee has a special property in the thing pledged.&#x0027; In a mortgage the title passes to the mort- gagee, subject to being revested in the mortgagor upon payment of the debt. In pledges the thing pledged must be delivered to the pledgee. In mortgages, generally, the possession of the thing mortgaged remains with the mortgagor. A mortgage of stock is the same as a pledge of stock in that the mortgagee may sell the stock upon default and after proper notice.2 In England a deposit 1 See Pars Cont., I, p 5D9; II, p. 113; III, p. 27.

			and hence while foreclosure would not lie as regards a pledge, itdoes lie as regards such an equitable mortgage.1
			A pledge differs also from a lion. A pledge, by implication, gives the pledgee a power to sell on duo notice, in case the debt is not paid at maturity, while a lion gives merely the power of deten- tion until the debt is paid.2
			Where a corporation is in financial difllcultics and its mortgage is duo, and the stockholders make an agreement with the mortgagee , whereby they turn over to him a majority of tile stock to become his absolute property if the debts of the corporation are not then paid, in consideration of which he agrees to advance further addi- tional moneys, such a contract is a conditional sale of the stock and is not a pledge.3 A contract to return borrowed stock or pay for it is a debt.&#x0027;

Mortgages and pledges of stoo7c-- Triust mortgages cover- igq stocks.- Shares of stock may be the subject of a mortgage or pledge.5 A mortgage of stock, however, is not often made; and, unless there is a clear intent to the contrary, the courts will treat the transaction as a pledge rather than a mortgage.5 In fact it is iillcult to ascertain from the cases how shares of stock may be Harold v.

Paine, 81 Ky, 410 (1883), where a chattel mortgage of a share of stock was duly recorded In the *proper county, the mortgagor retaining the certificate of stock. Thle mort- gagor subsequently sold and transferred the cortificato of stock to a bonl fldc purchaser. The court hold that the re- cording of tih mortgage was of no avail; that there could bo no mortgago of choses in action, and that tlhe bona slide transferee took the stock. Pryor, J., well said: "Much of the business of the country is conducted on the faith of the pledge of such stock ascollaterals; and to adjudge that the holder of the stock by transfer on the books of the corpora. tion, or by indorsement and delivery by the owner, is subordinate in his claim to the mortgagee, upon the doctrine of constructive notice, would paralyze trade and open a wide field for the fraudulent disposition of such valuable interests at the expense of honest and confiding purchasers." Inasmuch as a mortgage on shares of stock is not a re- cordable instrument, the record thereof does not operate as constructive notice. Shuster v. Jones, 58 S. V. Rep. 595 (Ky. 1900). Stocks are not goods and chat- tels within the meaning of the act con- cerning chattel mortgages. State v. King County Super. Ct,, 13 Wash. 007 (1896). The right of a subscriber to de- mand a certificate of stock may be at- tached before such certificate is issued and delivered, and such attachment has precedence over a mortgage even though the mortgage is recorded with the register of deeds, no notice, how- ever, of such mortgage being given to the corporation itself.

A mort- gage of stock is valid as between mort- gagor and mortgagee without a trans. for of certificates. The mortgagee after foreclosure may compel the corporation to transfer without making the trans. seree a party. Tregear tv Etiwanda Water Co., 70 Cal. si87 (1888). Stock may be mortgaged and no delivery of the certificates need be made. Though a foreclosure is made irregularly the mortgagor may ratify it, or may be barred bythe six-year statute of limita- tions. Campbell v. Woodstock Iron Co., 83 Ala. 851(1887). The pledgor may, by an instrument in writing, assign h.s equity of redemption to one of his cred. itors.

			a delivery is not strictly and legally a pledge.&#x0027; It "may have amounted to a mortgage, but it could amount to nothing more; and if a mortgage, it did not place the mortgagee in possession, but gave him norely a naked right to have the property appropriated and applied to the payment of his debt."2
			Whore, on the other hand, the certificate of stock is delivered to the creditor as security, it is evident that possession of the property is given to the creditor, but that the debtor still considers the stock to be his. Such a transaction is a pledge and not a mortgage; and consequently, since the giving of stock certificates as security iO alnost invariably effected by a delivery of the certificates, a mort- gage of stock may be said to be possible, but is not technically a correct use of the word. The delivery of a certificate of stock with a blank power of attorney, as collateral security, constitutes a pledge an(l not a mortgage; and the same rule prevails even though an absolute transfer or registry is made on the corpdrate books.4 A mortgage on shares of stock is sometimes made by transferring the stock to the trustee of the mortgage.1 The rights and duties of the trustee in such cases are considered elsewhere.0 A mortgage on shares of stock does not prevent the corporation controlled by such stock from issuing a mortgage on its property; and it is no breach of trust for the trustee of the first mortgage to be the trustee of the broad enough in its terms to do so, where both parties testify that it was not the intent to include the stock, and the mortgagee allowed the mortgagor&#x0027;s assignee to take away the stock.

He may then, in default of payment of the debt for which the thing is pledged, sell it for the purpose of raising tle amount, by merely giving proper notice to the pledgor. In the case of stocks and other choses in action, the pledgee must have possession of the certificate or other documentary title, with a transfer exe- cuted to himself, or in blank (unless payable to bearer), so as to give him the control and power of disposal of it, Such things are then called pledges, but more generally collaterals, and they may be used in the same manner as pledges properly so called. If there is no transfer attached to or accompany- ing the document, it is imperfect as a pledge, and requires a resort to a court of equity to give it effect."

An apparent sale of stock is not proven to be a pledge on the evidence
			of plaintiff, contradicted by defendant, when the full value of the stock was paid and a receipt therefor given by the plaintiff. Travors v. Leopold, 124 IlI. 481 (1888). A pledgor may bring a suit for an accounting and to establish the fact that the transfer of stook was a pledge, and lie may restrain a suit by the pledgee against the corporation for the stock. McDowell&#x0027;s Appeal, 123 Pa. St. 881 (1880). What appears to be an ab- solute sale may be shown to be a pledge, but the proof must be clear and con. elusive. MoLeod v. Weldon, 1 New Brunswick Eq. Relp 181 (1805). The relation of pledgor and pledgee may be proved by oral testimonyof the pledgee that lie bought the stock in the name of the pledgor, and became surety on money borrowed for that purpose, and that the stock was deposited in a cer- tain way as security. Sclwind v. Boyce, 51 Atl. Rep. 45 (MId. 1002). Where a written contract constitutes a sale of stock it cannot be shown to be a pledge unless a mutual mistake or fraud or other inequitable conduct is shown. Miller v. Carpenter, 68 N. Y. App. Div. 340 (1902). An apparently absolutesale of stock cannot be shown to be merely a pledge, unless the proof is clear, plain and convincing. Wilson v. Cunning- ham, 07 Pac. Rep. 118 (Utah, 1001). Where the owner of stock has pledged all of it to different parties, and ar. ranges with one of them to take up all the stock and the latter does so, and for several years treats it as his own, and the lower court finds that the agree- ment was that the pledgee should own it, the upper court will not disturb the decision, especially where the pledgor claims that he transferred the stock to avoid paying other creditors.

Tis rule prevails even though the charter pro. vides that the stock shall not be sold below par. Peterborough R. R v. Nashua, etc. R. R, 59 N. H. 885 (1870). Unissued stock may be issued by the corporation as a pledge to secure a loan, and the corporation cannot set up that it was issued at less than par in viola- tion of the constitution. The issue is good in the hands of the pledgee to the extent oftheloan. Gasquet v. Crescent City B Co., 49 Fed. Rep. 400 (1S82). Where the company issues its stock as collateral security to notes given to it by its subscribers in payment for such stock, and then sells the notes, the stock follows the notes and may be subjected to the payment of judgments on the notes If the corporation has issued the stock to others it must pay the judgments. Houston, etc. Ry. v. Bremond, 66 Tex. 159 (1880). A mort- gage is valid as against the corpora- tion giving it, although the officers give to the mortgagee their individual notes as additional security and cause the corporation to issue stock to them- selves without payment, which they deposit also as collateral with the mort- gagee. The giving of the mortgage is not an increase of indebtedness such as is prohibited by the Pennsylvania con-
			stitutlon. Powell v. Blair, 188 Pa. St. 550 (1800). Tle unissued stock of the corpo. ration may be issued to one of Its cred- itors as ollateral security. Parberry v. Woodson Sheep Co., 18 Mont. 817 (1800). The appointment of a receiver does not affect the rights of a pledgee from the corporation prior to such appointment. The pledgee may sell. National, etc. Bank v, Bonbrook, etc. Co., 27 S. W. Rep. 207 (Tex. 1804). A corporation may pledge treasury stock to a director. Whero treasury stock, instead of being given to the corporation, is placed in the hands of trustees under a trust agree- ment, such agreement may be modi- fled by a new agreement, and the stock turned over to the corporation. Kins- man v. Fisk, 83 Hun, 404 (1895). Ques- tions relative to the pledge by a com- pany of its own bonds are considered elsewhere. See § 703, infra. A oorpo- ration may pledge its bonds at less than par. Duncomb v. N. Y. etc. IR R, 84 N. Y. 100 (1881). In this case $84,000 of bonds were pledged to secure an over- due note for $5,000 and interest. The court said (p. 202) that the pledgee "had unquestionably the right to take as large a &#x0027;margin&#x0027; for his loan as the borrower was willing to grant. Nor can we discern any valid reason why a railroad corporation may not dispose of its bonds by way of pledge as well as of sale; and in the absence of proof that the proceeds of the loan were, with the knowledge of both parties, to be applied to some purpose not authorized by the statute permitting their issue, we can see no reason, as has already been said, why they might not be used as a pledge to secure an indebtedness already existing." 2 See §§ 247, 309-313, supra. 3 See Little v.

			amount than the pledgee bank is ontitled to loan to one person.&#x0027; A bonafido pledgee of stock is protected against claims of former owners of that stock to the same extent that an absolute purchaser of the stock would be proteoted, with the single exception that the power of a trustee or agent to sell stock does not give him power to pledge it.2 The quasi-nogotiability of certificates of stock pro- tects a pledgee and a vendee alikeo. The negotiab&#x0027;liLy of a note is not destroyed by a provision that certain bonds are given as collat- eral security for its payment.4 Where a trust company has orally agreed to hold certain bonds for delivery in accordance with cer- tillcates issued by another company, and subsequently the trust com- pany loans money to such other company and takes such bonds as security, the holders of the certificates may hold the trust company liable for not protecting the certificates.6

Y. Super. Ct. 70 (1887), holding that the New York statute of 1882 allows any interest if the debt is on demand and is over $5,000, and stock is pledged. The New York statute of 1882, as to bankers loaning on collateral, was ap- plied in Thomas v. Coffin. 62 Fed. Rep. 665 (1894), a case in which the taking of commissions was also involved. If stock is pledged to secure an usurious note, the pledgor may, under the New York statute, sue to recover back the stock without paying the debt. Dick- son v. Valentine, 6 N. Y.

			&#x0027;PLEDGO OF STOCK.
			[ou. XXVI. of another person, in order that he may protect his special prop- erty in the stock and at the same time not be liable thereon.&#x0027; It is proper and legal for a corporation to add to the name appearing on the stock certificate the words "as pledgee," or "as collateral security," or similar words.2 In some states there are statutes as well as decisions to the eflfct that notice to tho corporation that a peroon holds as pledgee certain certificates of stock, which stand on the books of the company in the pledgror&#x0027;s name, prevents an at- tachment against the pledgor from reaching more than the equity of redemption in such stock.3
			§ 467. Stock-broker l)prclhasing stock for a customer on a nmargiin is a pledyco of t17o stoGk.--It has been well established that, where a stock-broknr purchases stock on an order from his customer, and the customer does not pay for the stock, but deposits with the bro- ker a sum of money called a " margin," to protect the broker against loss, the broker is bound to have on hand the stock so purchased during the entire time of the contract, and has the rights, duties, and liabilities of a pledgee, with the customer as a pledgor.4 The broker under such circumstances must conform to all the rules governing a pledgee&#x0027;s attitude towards a pledgor. Ho cannot re- pledge, nor can he sell without due notice, unless such rights are given by the customer, the pledgor. A broker has no right to re- 98, 114 (but see p. 132) (1887). The pledgee may sue to have the pledge transferred to himself and determine the rights of other claimants. New- combe v. Lottimer, 12 N. Y. Supp. 881 (1890). The corporation must allow the registry. Cornick v. Richards, 3 Lea (Tenn.), 1 (1879). Where a contract does not merely pledge stock, but gives the creditor the legal title and unlimited power of disposition, the creditor may, by suit in equity, compel the company to allow a transfer, and the transferrer need not be made a party to the suit. Skinner v. Fort Wayne, etc. R. R, 58 Fed. Rep. 55 (1893). In California a pledgor may enjoin a pledgee from transferring stock into his name for the purposeof controlling an election,which otherwise the pledgor would control, where the statutes of the state provide for recording such a pledge without a transfer of the stock itself. Spreckels v. Nevada Bank, 113 Cal 272 (1896); Tom, etc. Co v. Green, 11 Colo. App.
			94
			447 (1808). A pledgee has power to have the stock transferred on the corporate books, and if it has agreed to hold cer- tain stock as security for a third per- son&#x0027;s note and fails to obtain a proper transfer, it is liable. First Nat. Bankv. Park, 91 N..W. Rep. 826 (Iowa, 1002).

			lateral or on a margin, unless the debt is transferred at the same time, or unless an express contract authorizes such ropledgeo. l Dykers v. Alien, 7 1ill, 407 (1844). A broker has no right to repledgo stock held by him for a customer to secure margins, and, oven if tho customer au- thorlzos him to roplodgo, this author- ity sustains a roplodgo only to the ex- tent of the amount due from the ous- tomer, and tlh broker must be ready at all times to return the stock to the customer upon the latter paying the debt. The ropledgee, under the usual transfer in blank on the back of the certificato, is not a bona fide pledgee. German Sav. Bank v. Ronshaw, 78 Md. 475 (1894D) Whore It was understood between a firm of brokors and its cus- tomers, for whom and on whose order it bought stocks on the security of a margin, that tle firm might, according to the usual course of business, pledge or hypothecate as security for loans to the firm the stocks thus bought, it was held that a mere pledge of such stocks would not be of itself a conver- sion. Chamberlain v. Greenleaf, 4 Abb. N. Cas. 178 (1878). See also Lawrence v. Maxwell, 58 Barb. 511 (1871); 0 Lans 400; 53 N. Y. 19. In Wood v. Hayes, 81 Mass. 875 (1800), it was held that " a broker who advanced money to buy stock for another, and held it in his own name, might, so long as he had not been paid or tendered the amount of his ad- vances, pledge it as security for his own debt to a third person, without making himself liable to an action by his employer; and this upon the ground that the contract was conditional to deliver the shares upon the payment of the money." Approved in Covell v. Loud, 135 Mass. 41 (1883), where it was held that, where the customer is un- able to advance further margin, and tells the broker to do the best he can, he may sell without notice. The de- cided weight of authority, however, holds that, unless the power is ex-
			pressly given to the broker to ropledge thi stook, ho cannot legally roplodgo It. A broker has no right to repledgo tho stocks held by him as collateral to ad- vancus to a customer, especially so after tlo customer has repaid tle ad. vanoes. Van Voorhis v. Iea, 153 Pa. St. 10 (1803). Where a broker, a gra- tuitous bailee of corporote stock, de- livers the same to tile company with. out authority, and the stock is converted to tle use of the company, the bailee is liable for its value, irrespective of what his intentions wore In the premises In such case the bailor may recover the value of the stock at tle time of con- version, with all dividends paid from the time of delivery, together with in- terest on the value of the stock from date of conversion, and on the divi- dends from date of respective payments. Hubbell v. Blandy, 87 Mich. 200(1801). A broker has no implied power to repledge. Skiff v. Stoddard, 03 Conn. 108 (1803). Where a broker repledges stock carried by him on a margin, the customer can- not, upon the failure of the broker, have all the broker&#x0027;s stock of that class first applied in discharge of the claim. Skiff v. Stoddard, 03 Conn. 108 (1893); Jamison&#x0027;s Assigned Estate, 3 Pa. Dist. 217 (1804). Where the pledgee converts the pledge by selling it, and then as- signs for the benefit of creditors, tle pledger comes in as any other creditor, and not as a preferred creditor. Re Jamison&#x0027;s Estate, 163 Pa. St. 143 (1804), holding also that the debt due from the pledger to the pledgee may be set off. Where the pledgee, without the knowl- edge of the pledger, sells one of the notes, and gives with it a part of the collateral as security, the pledger may pay that note and take all the security so given to the repledgee. The first pledgee cannot claim any lien on the part so repledged. McDonald v. Grant, 43

			In Massachusetts lifferent rules provail. In that state tho rulo is clearly laid down that a broker is not a plodgco of stocks which ho buys for his customer on a margin, but that, on tho contrary, the broker is the owner of the stocl and that ie is not bound to keep the stock of one customer distinct from that of another, but may take a single certillcate in his own nalno for several customers, and may pleldgo tlh stock for advances made to himself, and that lie is tlh person to be taxed on such stock.&#x0027; Where a broker sells lis client&#x0027;s stock illegally, the moasuro of damnages in a suit by tlh client is thie (liferenco between the price at which the stock was sold and the highest market prico within a reasonable timo there- after.2

Y. L. J., July 10, 1895, Supr. Ct Sp. T. A broker may pledge his customer&#x0027;s securities for an amount not exceed- ing the amount due from tih cus- tomer, but the broker must not put the securities beyond the reach of the customer, nor mingle such securities with others and hypothecate all of them for a large amount; the reason of this decision being that, so long as the customer could go to the pledgee and redeem the securities without loss, he, the customer, was not injured. Doug- las v. Carpenter, 17 N. Y. App. Div. 329 (1897). On this subject, see also § 471, infra, and § 457, supra. l The court realized, however, that its decision was not in accord with the current of authority and said," the Eng- lish doctrine seems to be the same as that of this commonwealth, so that we are not left quite alone in a desert of logic." Chase v. City of Boston, 02 N. E. Rep. 1050 (Mass. 1002). In Massa- chusetts a broker who purchases stock for a customer on a margin is not a pledgee, but is merely under contract to deliver the stock on payment of the balance, and hence he may pledge the stock or sell it, and is not in default
			until the customer has tendered the balance and demanded the stock. If the broker is adjudicated a bankrupt the customer may treat this as a breach of contract and prove his claim. In re Swift, 105 Fed. Relp 403 (1000). See also g 457, supra. 2Wolff r. Lockwood. 70 N. Y. App. Div. 509 (1902). The measure of dam- ages in a suit by a customer against a broker for an unauthorized sale of stock is the difference between the price at whicll it was sold and the highest price within a reasonable time thereafter, which, in this case, the court fixed at thirty days. Burhorn r Lockwood, 71 N. Y. App. Div. s01 (1902). 3 Herrman v. Maxwell, 47 N. Y. Super. Ct. 347 (1881). And the pledger who collects them holds them in trust for the pledgee. Hill v.

Where a stockholder of record pledges his cer- tificates of stock, and no transfer is made on the books, and subsequently a dividond is declared, and after such dividend is payable, but before it is actually paid, the pledgee presents to the company the stock for transfer, with a written request of the pledger to the same effect, together with an as- signment by the pledgor to the pledgee of the dividend, it is no defense to the company that it has a claim against the pledgor for a personal debt, or for a debt of a firm in which he is interested. American. etc. Bank v. Nashville. etc. Co.. 30 S. W. Rep. 000 (Tenn. 1890). The corporation is liable to a pledgee. to whom the stock has been transferred on the books, for dividends paid to the pledger. The acceptance of part pay- ment, etc., by the pledgee from the pledgor does not waive his cause of nc- tion against the company. Boyd v. Consholocken Worsted Mills, 149 Pn. St. 303 (1892). In Maine it has been held that while a corporation may pay an ordinary dividend to a stockholder of record, yet that a dividend paid in the liquidation and winding up of the cor- poration must be paid to the holder of the certificate, even though such holder

The pledgee is entitled to the dividends, even though the stock stands in the name of the pledgor on the books of the company. George, etc. Co. tv Range, etc. Co., 10 Utah, 59(1807). Where stock still stands in the name of the pledgor and an attachment iL levied upon it, dividends that accrue there- after belong to the pledgee, both as against the pledger and his creditors. Farmers,&#x0027; etc. Bank v. Mosler, 88 N. W. Rep. 552 (Neb. 1901). Where tle stock still stands in the name of the pledgor there is no duty imposed on the pledgee to collect the dividends declared thereon. McAulay v. Moody, 128 Cal. 202 (1900).

A pledgee may, howevor, pay assessments levied upon tlh stock, such assess- ments being a lion prior to his lion, and may charge such payments as expenses in preserving and protecting tlhe title anl making thle security available on maturity.6 A pledgee of certificates of stock is protected against further sales or pledges of the samo stock by the pledgor, such other sales or pledges being without the delivery of any certificate, the same as the venleo of a certificate of stock is protected against another sale of the stock to a purchaser who takes without any cortilicate.7 The possession of the certilicato protects the pledgee herein. The plodgee is not liable for a loss of the pledge by theft, there being no negligence on his part.8 But where the pledgee is a corporation, and the president, who has en- tire charge of its alfairs, steals the securities, the corporation is liable to the pledger for the value thereof, on the principle that a bailee for hire is liable for negligence in regard to the pledge.9

In McCaleb v. Good- win, 114 Ala. 015 (1897), one street rail- way purchased all the stock of another street railway and paid the stockholders therefor by issuing the mortgage bonds of the latter street railway company. The former then placed the stock under its own mortgage, and, this mortgage having been foreclosed, the purchaser attacked the validity of the first-men- tioned mortgage. The court sustained the mortgage, however, on the ground that all the stock had voted therefor.

The pldgeoo is not bound to aid the pledgor in using the pledge in a reorganization, nor is the pledgco bound to dellay the reorganization on account of any demand of tile plodgor.&#x0027; Where a pledgeoe&#x0027;s debt has really boon paid and yet lie retains the stock, and by reason thereof the pledgor is unable to enter a reorganization, the pledgor can recover for the actual ndamages sustained, but suchl vlue must be shown by him; otherwise it will be inferred that it had little or no value.&#x0027; Even though a pledgee of bonds accepts common stock in a re- organized company in place of the bonds, yet, if both the bonds ant the common stock are worthless, the pledgor is not released from his debt, and even if the common stock had value it would be merely a substituted collateral." Where the maker of a note secured by bonds as collateral causes the pledgee to exchange the bonds for bonds in a reorganized company, it is for the jury to say whether that amounts to an acknowledgment of the debt postponing the statute of limitations.0 A pledgor of stock may enforce a claim against the corporation, even though thereby the corporation will become insolvent and the stock be rendered worthless. Although the pledgor has made an assignment for the benefit es creditors, yet his assignee cannot be enjoined by the pledgee from enforcing the claim against the corporation.7

Wheoro stock is tied up by attachment which is afterwards vacated, and in the mecantime the stock depreciates in value, the loss can be recovered from the attaching party if the stocks could and would have been sold before the depreciation, if they had not been so tied up.

			as has been plcdged to him. A "loan " of stock returnable on de- mand transfers tile title in one sense, inasmuch as the borrower may return similar stock of the same amount, in place of returning the identical stock which was loaned to him.&#x0027;
			§ 470. Plledgee&#x0027;s liability on subsoription and statuttory liability on stoock.3- A pledgee who has obtained registry on the corporate books appears to third parties as a full stockholder. Accordingly, in case the corporation becomes insolvent, the registered pledgee is held liable on his stock, as though he were an absolute stock- holder. In order to avoid this clanger, the law allows the pledgee to have the pledged stock registered on the corporate books in the name of a nominee of the pledgee.4 Where such a registry is ob- tained, the pledgee has the advantage of the control of the stock, and at the same time escapes the danger of liability as a stock- holder.
			§ 471. Pledgee has no right to sell or repleldgo the. stooc oven temn porarily, except tl)upo notice, muless the debt is assigned wQith the stock.-" Equity will not tolerate a separation of the pledge from the debt, and they must stand together, and will force upon a wrong-doer the character of a trustee, and thus compel him to do justice." Such is the language of the New York court of appeals.6 The pledgee of stock cannot legally part with the possession of the stock by a sale or repledge of it, except as he transfers the debt which the stock secures. If he does so he is guilty of aconversion,6 I Fay v. Gray, 124 Mass. 500 (1878). 2Fosdiok v. Greene, 27 Ohio St. 484 (1875); Dykers v. Allen, 7 Hill 407 (1844).

Rep. 677 (1883). c Oregon, etc. Co. v. Hilmers, 20 Fed. Rep. 717 (1884); Gass v. Hampton, 10 Nev. 185 (1881). Brokers holding a cer- tificate of stock as security for the bal- ance of the purchase price due from the customer are pledgees, and if the broker, in violation of the express con- tract, repledges or sells such stock without authority from the customer, he is guilty of a conversion, for which trover will lie. Chew v. Louchheim, 80 Fed. Rep. 500 (1897). The caseof Ex
			parte Sargent, L. . 17 Eq. 278 (1874), contained a dictum giving a contrary rule; but France v. Clark, L. R 22 Ch. D. 830 (1883), disapproves such dictum and says: " As a general rule the paw- nee of chattels has no right to sell them, unless a time was originally fixed for their redemption, and that time has expired, or unless he has made a demand upon the pawnor for the pay- ment of what is due him." Fay v. Gray, 124 Mass. 500 (1878), holds that the pledgee has no right to sell, lend, or repledge the stock. In the notes in 21 Am. Law Reg. (N. S.) 454-401, a con- tention is made that the pledgee should be allowed to repledge, but it is admit- ted that the weight of authority holds otherwise.

			penal offenso for the pledgee to ropledgo the stock.2 Even whore, apparontly,thlo plodgor would not be injured by tlho pledgee&#x0027;s separating thl stock from the debt and transferring the stock pledged as collateral security, yet the law rigidly protects tlh in- terests of tho debtor and pledger, and will not compel him to sub. mit to the danger of such transfers by the plodgoo. There may, of course, be an express agreement or understanding to the con- trary.3 Where an agent has wrongfully pledged his principal&#x0027;s stock, and the pledgee then wrongfully converts the pledge, tho (N. S.) 503 (1880); Work v. Bennett, 70 Pat. St. 184 &#x0027;1872) Wood v. Hayes, 81 MIns. 875 (1800); Thompson v. Patrick, 4 Watts (Pa.), 414 (185J); and see § 400, supra. In Lawrence v. Maxwell, 58 N. Y. 10 (1808), the court said: "Ordi- nlrily, aid in the absence of an agree- ment or assent by the pledger, the pledgee would have no right to use the thing pledged, and a use of it would be illegal. But, under special circum- stances depending somewhat upon the nature of the pledge, and in all cases with the assent of the pledgor, express or implied, the property pledged may be used by the pledgee in any way con. sistent with the generalownership and the ultimate rights of the pledgor." Where the pledgee has an option to purchase the stock, but, instead of pur. chasing, he repledges it illegally, the pledgor may consider this as an exer- cise of the option. Upham v. Barbour, 65 Minn. 804 (1800). Where the pledgee transfers the stock to another person as security that a proposed contract between the corporation and another corporation will be ratified at a stock- holders&#x0027; meeting, and such other person votes said stock at such stockholders&#x0027; meeting, the pledgee is guilty of con- version of the stock. Upham v. Bar- bour, 05 Minn. 804 (1896). Where a pledge is made to secure the return of certain sstock and bonds to a third party, and the pledgor dies, the pledgee may pledge the securities to bring about the return of such stock and

Allen, 70 Mo. 200 (1870). A broker has no right to repledge stock held by him for a customer to secure margins, and, even if the customer au- thorizes him to repledge, this authority sustains a repledge only to the extent of the amount due from the customer, and the broker must be ready at all times to return the stock to the cus- tomer upon the latter paying the debt. In this case it was held also that the repledgee, under the usual transfer in blank on the back of the certificate, is not a bonafide pledgee. German Sav. Bank v. Reushaw, 78 Md. 475 (1804). The right of the pledgee to repledge may exist by force of a custom under- stood by both parties. Chamberlain v. Greenleaf, 4 Abb. N. Cas. 178 (187). Ols. xxvI.]

The pledgee may assign his interest in the pledgo and( transfer the pledge to such as- signeo. Overton, Liens, §g 108, 172; Sohoul. Bailin. (2d ed.), § 218, etc. Story, Bailm.. § 824, says the pawnee "may sell or assign all his interest in the pawn, or lie may convey the same in- terest conditionally, by way of pawn to another person, without in either case destroying or invalidating his se- curity." See also Talty v. Freedman&#x0027;s Sav. etc. Co., 93 U. S 321 (1876); 2 Kent, Com. 579; Jarvis v. Rogers, 13 Mass. 105 (1810). 15 Iass. 389, 408; Mlores v. Con- ham, Owen, 123 (1010); Ratcliffe v.

Y. 894 (1807), where, after the debt was due and unpaid, the pledgee turned over the debt and security to another without a foreclosure or sale on notice, the court held that the latter could hold the collateral stock until the pledgor tendered the amount of the debt. The latest English cases hold that, although the repledge may be wrong, yet that the pledger cannot re-
			claim the stock from the repledgeo until the former pays the debt for which the pledge was made. Donald v. Suckling, L. R 1 Q. B. 585 (1800); Hal- liday v. Holgnto, L. R. 8 Exch. 219 (1808). Where a broker, holding stock in pledge on a margin, repledges it without the consent of his customer, it has been held that lie cannot recover the value of the stock from the customer on a tender of the certificate. Clarkson v. Snider, 6 Can. L T. 587 (1885) In Lang- ton v. Waite, L R. 0 Eq. 105 (1808), the court said that the law was clear that, in the absence of express contract to the contrary, a pawnee cannot sell without the express permission of tho owner, and that if he does, theownercan charge him with the excess of the price over the loan. The court, however, seemed to think that the pledgee could repledge thestock. In Gould v. Farmers&#x0027; L. &#x0026; T. Coa, 23 Hun, 822 (1880) the court said that the pledgee might repledge the stock so far as he had an interest in it. 3Philler v. Yardley, 02 Fed. Rep. 045, 049 (1894). 4Pauly uv Wilson, 57 Fed.

			Whore a bank takes in pledge from a broker stock which the bank knows belongs to a customer of the broker, the bank cannot hold such stock as against the customer, even though the stock was indorsed in blank on the back of the certificates.3 A pledgee who knows that the pledger is acting as agent, or that the pledger holds tlhe stock in pledge, must take notice.of the powers of such pledger.4 Whero the pledgee sells the debt and stock to another person, and the latter sells tleo stock without the debt, and the purchaser sells the stock to still another person, the various sales being a conspir- acy, the pledger may sue the various purchasers for conversion, and need not tender the debt or make any demand before commencing suit.5 Where the owner of stock anti bonds turns them over to a trust company to sell as it should deem best and rpturn one-half of the proceeds, and the trust company in violation of the trust pledges theml for a past-duo debt, the remedy of the owner against the pledgee is not for conversion, but for an accounting.0

			This rule arises, not on tho ground that the cortifcato of stock is negotiable, but for tleo reason that the owner is hold to have on- itblod his pledgeo to sell tho stock as the pledgeo&#x0027;s own, and thnt as between tile owner and tile obona fido purchaser or pledgo from0 tile pledgoo tile owner must bonr tho loss. The law of estoppel pre- vents his ldnying tho right of his pledgoo to sell or pledge, as against a bona fido purchaser or pledgee fromn tile pledg(l . So, also, this principle arises under the well-established rulo that, whore one of two :nnocent parties inust sull&#x0027;er from the fraud of a tlird, the loss must fall upon hilm who enabled the tlird party to porpe- trato tle frtaud. In Nebraska it has been held that a stockholder transfers thoer into his own nlamo on tile books of the company and takes out now cortillcatos, a bona fie purchaser or pledgeo from him Is protected. West- inghouse v. German, etc. Bank, 190 Pi, St. 210 (1900). A bona fide pledgee of a cortillcate of stock from an agent hav- ing power to pledge, but who had so pledged tile stock for purposes not au. thlorized by the owner, is nevertheless protected, and even though such pledgee sells the stock at private sale without notice he cannot be held liable if the stock was not wortl more than the debt secured. Brittan v. Oakdale, etc., 12-L Ca;. 282 (1800). A bonafide pledgee of fraudulently issued warehouse receipts can enforce them only to the extent of the loan and interest. Corn, etc. Bank v.

Brown, 47 L J. tCI.) 108 (1878), the court, following the English doctrine that an unregistered transferee of certificates of railway stock has no more rights than his trans- ferrer, refused to protect the unregis- tered repledgee of stbck. A bonafide purchaser of pledged stock is protected in his title. Krouse v. Woodward, 110 Cal. 038 (1805). Where stock is pledged as collateral, and the pledgee sells to a bonafide purchaser without notice, such purchaser is protected, even though he at the same time purchases the note for which the stock is collateral. Strick- land v. Leggett, 21 N. Y. Supp. 350 (1892). A bona fide transferee, abso- lutely or in pledge from a broker, hold-
			(01) O0
			ing his customer&#x0027;s stock in pledge, is protected to tho extent of the transfer, the transferee having no notice of the fact thait the stock was held in pledge by tlh broker. Thompson v. Toland, 48 Cal. 00 (1874); Zuliclok . Markliam, 0 Daly, 120 (1875): and see many cases in § 821, sulr&#x0027;te. These cases apply equally whether the person transferring con- trary to law is an agent or a pledgee, and equally, also, whether he sells or only repledges. In a decision in Maryland an Important distinction is drawn between the rights of a bona fide purchaser and a bona fide pledgee. It is held that the usual form of trans- ser on the back of certificates of stock, signed by the stockholder, with the name of the transferee left blank, does not protect a bona fide pledgee. The pledgee is chargeable witl notice of all the facts and equities. Under this de- cision it would seem to be necessary in Maryland to enlarge the terms and form of the usual assignment and power of attorney on the back of certificates of stock. German Sav. Bank v. Renshaw, 78 Md. 475 (1804), a case wherein a brc.- ker holding stock on a margin re- pledged it at a bank. Where the pledgee repledges stock to a bonafide pledgee, and the original pledger sues the first pledgee for conversion, the original pledger cannot then sue the repledgee on the theory that the re- pledge was not properly made.

Where a broker repledges stock held by him in pledge and then becomes insolv- ent, the original pledgors may claim a surplus remaining after a sale of the stock by the repledgee. Such surplus does not belong to the estate of the bro- ker. Even though the broker bad also pledged with such stock certain secu- rities which had been deposited with him, not in pledge, but to sell, the owner of such securities can share pro- portionately in such surplus, but has no right superior to the pledgor&#x0027;a Rhine- lander v. National City Bank, 86 N. Y.
			App. Div. 11 (1800). Whero the pledgee repledges the stock to a bank and tlion goes into bankruptcy, and the bank after selling all tile securities held by it as pledgee of the bankrupt Ihas a siur plus equal to the amount of the stock so repledged, the original pledger is entitled to such excess. In re Swift, 108 Fed. Rep. 212 (1001). Where the pledgee repledges the stock in breach of trust, the original pledger is entitled to the surplus after the repledgee las sold his stock and paid his debt, oven though the original pledgee is in bank- ruptcy. Hutchinson v. Le Roy, 113 Fed. Rep. 202 (1002). Even though a broker repledges the stocks of various customers without authority from them, the pledgee is protected if he had no knowledge of the fact that the broker did not qwn the stocks; and if the pledgee, after selling out the stocks on notice, has a balance remaining both of money and stocks, the customers pro- rate as to such balance, even though the stocks of some of them were not sold by the pledgee. This rule is based on the principle that if they all had united in redeeming from the pledgee they would have borne the loss prorata. Whitlock v. Seaboard Nat. Bank, 20 N. Y. Misc.

Where tile pledgee wrongfully rehypothecates tile pledge, together with other securitlos, tile pledgor may pay the debt due to the repledgeo and take all the securities and sell them all out, and may also sue the pledgee for conversion. Tlo court will roquire the pledger to indorse upon the judgment for conversion a suitable credit for the amiount realized out of such sale of the securities by the pledgor. The court said that if a bona flde re. pledgee is informed of the conversion by the original pledgee, the repledgeo is then bound, in case he sells out the securities, to turn over the surplus to the pledgor. The court also held that the repledgee, upon receiving notice, was bound to resort to other collateral before selling the collateral wrongfully repledged by the pledgee. to the re. pledgee. A receiver of the pledgee has no greater rights than the pledgee him- self. Union Pac. Ry. v. Schiff, 78 Fed. Rep. 210 (1897).

Where, howover, tho cus- tomier had not authorized tile broker to roplodgo the stock, then the stock owned by the broker and.pledged together with the stock of the customer will lirst bo npplied to tlho debt.&#x0027; Whero a customer delivers stock to a broker and the broker without his consent trims- sers it into his own name, tile customer may claim the new certill- cate upon satisfactorily identifying the stock.y Where a customer pledges his stock with the broker, and the latter wrongfully re- pledges it and fails, and tlh customer notifies the repledgeo of his claim and demands notice of any sale, the repledgee is liable if ho sells without notice to the former and turns the surplus over to til assignee of the broker.&#x0027;
			Where a pledgeor becomes insolvent the question often arises as to whether the pledgee may prove his entire claim against the cs- tate, or whether the pledgee must first realize what he can from the pledge and then present a claim for the deficiency only. The rule is now well established, however, that the pledgee may prove his entire claim against the insolvent estate of the pledgor, and may demand his proportionate part of such estate, the same as though ho had no collateral security whatsoever.4 A creditor the stock so repledged, the pleilgor cat not reclaim such stock. Deitz v. Fielc 10 N. Y.

Wheeler v. Walton, etc. Co., 72 Fed. Rep. 900 (1800). Soo also § 470, infrla The fiact that a creditor&#x0027;s claim is se- cured by mortgage or otherwise does not affect his right to prove for the full amount of the claim, nor does the fact that he has realized part thereof out of the collateral since the date of the re- ceiverdhlip; but in the latter case lie is entitled to dividends only until the balance of his debt is satisfied. New York Security, etc. Co. t: Lombard Inv. Co.,73 Fed. Rep. 537 (1890). The pledgee may file his claim in the probate court against the pledger&#x0027;s estate, and may then sell the pledge, and will be en- titled to participate in the estate with- out deduction of the amount realized on the sale, unless he would thereby receive more than the whole debt. Furness v. Union Nat. Bank, 147 III. 570 (189:3) Where a pledgee has real- ized on his security, he participates in the insolvent estate of the pledger on only the balance remaining due to him. Philadelphia Warelouse Co. v. Anniston Pipe Works, 100 Ala. 357 (1895). In Nebraska, the court, after reviewing the conflicting rules in the different states, held that where a cred- itor held collateral he must deduct from his claim all that he realizes from the collateral, before he can get a divi- dend, and must also deliver up his col- lateral to the receiver. State t. Ne- braska Sav. Bank, 40 Neb. 342 (1894). Where a corporation assumes a mort- gage and then becomes insolvent, the

			mortgagor is entitled to a dividend from its assets on the wholo mortgage debt existing at the time of sulch us- sumption, even though the mortgugor has foroolosed and realized a part of the debt. Mlatter of Simpson, 80 N. Y. App. Div. 502 (1800). Collateral secOu rity furnished by the stockholders to a corporate creditor is not to be deducted before the claim participates in the us- sets of the insolvent corporation, al- though the rule is diflerent in Mary- land where the security was furnished to tih corporation itself, Rogers v. Citizens&#x0027;, etc. Bank, 03 Md. 013 (1001). Where the stockholder has died and his estate is being distributed, the portion going to the corporation by reason of its lien will not be decreased by the amount of dividends. In re Hovey&#x0027;s Estate, 108 Pa. St. 885 (1001). Under the New Hampshire statutes the holder of a mortgage as security for a note cannot prove the full amount of the note in insolvency proceedings, but must first deduct the value of the se- curity; but the rule is otherwise as to an indorsement made by the insolvent party. Bank Com&#x0027;rs v. Security, etc. Co., 70 N. HL 536 (1001). 1 Welch v. Sargent, 127 Cal. 72 (1899).

A bontftde holder for value and without notice is protected, while one who takes with notice is not protected. Where, however, the one taking stock in pledge from an agent knows that the latter is acting as agent, he is bound to inquire whether the principal has authorized his agent to pledge the stock, since a power to pledge cannot be presumed from a power to sell.6 The express power of an agent to sell securities is revoked by the death of the principal, and if he sells thereafter he is liable for damages in conversion.7 urers&#x0027; Nat.

The pledgor&#x0027;s remedy is at law.&#x0027; The fact that a pledger claims that the pledgee owes him more money than he owes the pledgee is not sufficient to sustain a bill in equity to enjoin the pledgee from selling the stock in order to pay the amount due. Some other ground&#x0027; of equitable jurisdiction must be set forth.8 Where the pledgee of stock has been guilty of a conversion of it, the pledgor&#x0027;s remedy against him is generally by an action at law for lWoodside v. Grafflin, 91 Md. 422 is insolvent. Syracuse, etc. Ry. v. Salt (1000). Springs, etc. Bank, 28 N. Y. Misc. Rep. 2 See cli. XIX, supra. 019 (1800). O&#x0027;Herron v. Gray, 168 Mass. 573 8 Elliott t.

Blood v. Erie, etc. Loan Co., 104 l&#x0027;a. St.05(1804). Aninjunction against a pledgee disposingof stock owned by a certain party, or an attachment upon the interest of that party, does not prevent the pledgee selling the stock if such stock really belonged to the wife of that party. Fourth Nat. Bank, etc. v. Crescent, etc. Co., 52 S. W. Rep. 1021 (Tenn. 1897). l Allen v. Dykers, 8 Hill (N. Y.), 003 (1842); asf&#x0027;d, Dykers v. Allen, 7 Hill (N. Y.), 407; New York, etc. R.

However, a later case in Massachu- setts-Cumnock v. Newburyport Sav. Inst., 142 Mass. 342 (1880)-holds that a tender of payment of a debt is neces- sary to ienable a pledgor to maintain trover for a conversion of property pledged, unless the lien created by the pledge has been otherwise discharged. "After the sale by the pledgee, the pledger need not make a tender of the amount due nor a demand of the se- curities before bringing his action .... A formal tender of the amount of the notes would have been a useless cere-
			lnony, such as the law never requires" Flotchor v. Dickinson, 80 Massn. 3 (1803). Wheor the customer sues the brokeor for selling the stock illegally, the broker maly set up the amount duo from the customer, not by way of recoupment, but by way of a lien on the stock. Far- rar r. Paine, 178 Mass. 58 (1800). A sale by a pledgee without notice is a cqn- version, and the pledgor may sue for the value of the stock without tender- ing the debt, but the pledgee may re- coup to the extent of a debt. Feige v. Burt, 118 Mlich. 243 (1808). A pledgor&#x0027;s vendee may tender the amount of the debt and demand the stock as a condi- tion of payment. Trover lies for a re- fusal of pledgee to deliver. The pledgee is liable for depreciations of stock after such tender. An attachment of stock against the pledgor, but after sale by him, is no defense to the pledgee. Ten- der is sufficient without paying the money into court. Loughborough v. McNevin, 74 Cal. 250 (1887). See also Thompson v. St. Nicholas Nat. Bank, 113 N. Y. 325 (1889), and § 401, supra. The pledgee sued for conversion may set off the debt due him. Van Shaick r. Rnm- sey, 00 Hun, 550 (1895). Where the pledgee buys the security at the public sale and then sells it, and then sues the pledgor for the deficiency on the first sale, the pledgor may claim a set-off for the full value of the securities wrongfully resold, and need not make a tender. Rush v. First Nat. UBatnk, 71 Fed. Rep. 102 (1895), reviewing the au- thorities on tender in such cases. 909 Oil, XXVI.]

			Seo oh. XXXV, infra. In Fowlo v. Ward, 118 Mass. G48 (1873!, the court said the damages shouhl be "a sum of money which would enable him to pur- ohase seventoen new shares to replace those whioll have bcen taken from him, with such additional sum as would in- demnify him for the divdlends which he has lost since the sale, and also an equitable allowance for interest" Where tih pledgee refuses to deliver up the stool upon a tender of the debt lie is liable in damages for the value of the stock on the day of the tender and demand, less the amount tendered. Franklin Bank v. Harris, 77 Md. 423 (1893). &#x0027;See cases in note 1, p. 974, infra. 4 Atkins v. Gamble, 42 Cal. 80, 91 (1871). If tlere are several pledgors, and the pledge is redeemed, and the pledgee, at the request of one of the pledgors, trans- sers the stock to third parties, the pledgee is liable to the other pledgors for the loss in:urred thereby. Magnus r. Queensland Nat. Bank, L R. 36 Ch. D. 25 (1887). 5See § 471, supra. 6 Tle form of a complaint or declara. tion in an action by a pledgor against a pledgee for the conversion of the stock hleld in pledge may be in tort or in as- sumlpsit. but not in both. Stevens v. Hurlbut Bank, 31 Conn. 146 (1802). It is a conversion for the pledgee to retain the stock after the principal of the debt is paid, nothing being said about interest, Kullman v. Greenebaum, 02 CaL 403 (1801). A complaint which,

			after stating that shares of stock hiad boen pledged to defendant, avers that "defendant, In consideration of the premises, then and there undertook and promised to plaintiff " to hold the stock only as pledgee, but that, in violation of its promise, oefendant sold and con- verted the stoock to its own use, without giving plaintiff notice of the sale, and In which plaintiff seeks to recover as damages the full value of the sharcs alleged to have been converted, though informal, is good as a complaint In case. Sharpe v. Birmingham Nt. Ba&#x0027;nk, 87 Al. 044 (1888). This case discussed also the difference between assutnpsit and case in such an action. In Butts v. Bur- nett. 0 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 302 (1800), involv- ing the arrest of a broker who hnd sold the pledge before the note was due, the court said: " It is very questionable, I think, whether a demand after default in payment of the debt for which prop- erty is pledged as security will render a refusal to deliver the pledged prop- erty a tortious conversion of it No doubt the pledger can redeem upon a tender of the debt, or he may recover the difference between the value of the pledge and the debt. But to lay the foundation for an action for conversion, I am of opinion that an offer and de- mand must be made on the day, and is not sufficient if made after the day on which the debt has become payable." As to the complaint in an action by a pledger against the pledgee for not re- turning goods pledged, see 2 Chitty, PL 00; Stanton u. Collier, 3 El. &#x0026; BI. 274 (1854).

			conversion will not bo construed as a complaint for broach of con- tract.&#x0027; Tile pledgor may, if ho prefers, begin suit in a court of equity, when the pledgoo has converted the stock, and compel him either to replace the stook or give compensation in damages. Tho jurisdiction of a court of equity in such a case lias boon denioed, but in certain cases may be sustained on the ground that only a court or cquity can compol a retransfor of the stock or an accounting of tloe dividendls dcolared while the pledge was running, or an account- ing by third persons to whom the pledgee has assigned tle debt unld plo(dgo, or enjoin an illegal transfer of the stock.&#x0027; A pledgor not deny tho possession by the defend- ant of cortain stocks belonging to the phllntiff, nor the tender of tie balance Ilue, nor the demand for such stocks, nor the non-dolivery of the same. Du- bois v. Sintare, N. Y. L. J., De. 9, 1890. See Smith v. Savin, 141 N. Y. 815i (1891). Wllero tlh repledgeo converts the stock the remedy for conversion Is with the flrst pledgee, not with the first pledger. Thompson v. Toland, 48 Cal. 009 (1874). Contra, Smith v. Savin; 69 Hun, 811 (1893). See s c., 0 N. Y. Supp. 100, and 11 N. Y. 815. A pledge of stock. to se- clro future liabilities does not securo past liabilities. If the pledgee refuses to surrender the stock on demand and tender, the pledger may recover the value of the stock on thht day, less the amount tendered. Franklin Bank v. Harris, 77 Md. 423 (1803). Where the pledgor learns of the illegality of the sale after he has commenced suit for the surplus, he will be allowed to amend and sue for conversion. Smith v. Savin, 141 N. Y. 315 (1894). ISmith v. Hall, 67 N.&#x0027;Y. 48 (1876), dis- tinguishing Austin v. Rawdon, 44 N. Y. 03 (1870). 2 Lacombe v. Forstall&#x0027;s Sons. 123 U. S. 562 (1887); Genet v. Howland, 45 Barb. 560 (1866). The remedy of the pledgor is at law after a tender, not by bill in equity to redeem. Doak v. Bank of the State, 0 Ired. L. (N. C.) 300 (184). Where the pledgee has sold the stock, the pledger cannot compel him to restore it by a bill in equity, even though he
			alleges that the sale was to a person who holds the stook as trustee for the pledgee. The pledgor&#x0027;s remodyis at law. Hlnokley v. Plister, 88 Wis. 04 (1802). A bill in equity does not lie for damages duo to an illegal sale ot stock by a pledgee. Henry tv Travelers&#x0027; Ins. Co., 45 Fed. Rep. 299 (1801). A pledger can- not file a bill In equity to hold the pledgee liable for selling the stock in violation of the pledge, there being no disputed accounts. Ioland v. Lancas- ter, etc. Bank, 135 Pa. St. 008 (1890); Angus v. Robinson. 02 Vt. 00 (1890). It is well settled that a bill in equity will not ordinarily lie to redeem property fron a.pledge. Kemp v, Westbrook, 1 Ves. Sr. 278 (1740); Story, Eq. Jur., s 1032. ereaniso The reason isobviou Te legal title to the thing pledged does not pass to the pledgee, as it does to a mortgagee in, possession in the case of a mortgage. The pledgor retains the legal title and parts only with possession and a special property. Jones, Pledges, . 552. He has therefore a legal right to redeem, and upon tendering the amount due to the pledgee he may bring replevin for the collateral or an action to recover its value. It is only when his legal reme- dies are insufficient that the pledgor can come into equity. Jones, Pledges, § 550. and cases cited. 3 Bryson v.

In a suit in equity by the pleodgor to re. deemo, tlhe pledgee cannot set up that the pledgor has sold his interest in the pledge to another party, and that an- other suit is pending brought by that other party for specilic performance, and that in such suit the pledgee is a party defendant, no proof being given of such sale. Houston, etc. RI R. v. Conner, 67 S W. Rep. 773 (Tex. 1902). Where the pledge has been sold by the pledgee and the amount due is in dis- pute. the pledger may file a bill in equity against the pledgee and the pur- chaser with notice and the corporation to redeem it, and he need not make any tender of the amount due, provided he offers in his complaint to pay any amount found due. Treadwoll v. Clark, 73 N. Y. App. Div. 473 (1902).

In this case tile stock was of uncertain valuo,and represented a controlling interest in the colmpany, and damages for its conversion would not have been an adequate remedy. Tleo court held that an action for re- plevin was not adequate, inasmuch as, in order to bring replevin, tile pledgor would have to tender the debt, which, according to tle original agreement, was not yet due. Hower v. Weiss, etc. Co., 55 Fed. Rep. 350 (1803). " If, for in. stance, the collaterals consist of shares of stock which have been transferred into the pledgee&#x0027;s name upon the books of a corporation, an action in equity willlie, for the reason that such an ac- tion is necessary to secure the retrans- ser of the shares.

A pur- lchaser or stock who maklos a partial lllymllont and gives back tlh stock as collateral security cannot abandlo til contraot and claim such part of the stocl as tile piayilent already made would pay for, on the ground tlat the seller has obtained control of tile corpo- ration and is guilty of a broach of trust. The fact tlint the seller as pledgee has sold tlh stock and bought t it in himself is inmaterial, inasmiuch as such salo is illegal. Roid .t Caldwoll, 110 Ga. 481 (100); a. a., 114 Ga. 070 (1002). I Eight years&#x0027; delay by the pledger in complaining of tile refusal of tle pledgee to deliver up. the stock on tender of the debt, the stock having subse- quently declined in value, was held to bo fatal in Morriam v. Childs, 03 Mo. 131 (1887). Where the pledgor&#x0027;s exec- utor, for value received, sells the pledg- or&#x0027;s interest to the pledgee, long lapse of time after full knowledge of the facts by all parties will raise a pre- sumption in favor of the pledgee&#x0027;s complete ownership. Lockwood v. Brantly, 1 Silvern. 187 (1880); .a , 103 N. Y. 680. As to the statute of limit- ations, see Maynard v. Tilden, 28 Fed. Rep. 088, 703 (1880); Child uv Hugg, 41 Cal. 519 (1891), where long delay was held to be a bar. In Greene v. Dispeau, 14 R 1. 575 (1884), a pledge of stock was treated as a mortgage, and the right to redeem was held to be barred six years after the date of the mortgage. A pledger waives informality of the no- tice, where, after the sale, lie, as an of- sicer of the corporation, enters a trans- ser of the stock to the one who pur- chasedat the sale. Downer v. Whittier, 144 Mass 448(1887). Four years&#x0027; delay
			in complailning is fatatl. Receving the bonolit of the sale is a waiver of objec- tions. McDowoll tv Chicago Steel Works, 124 III. 491 (1888). Although the pledgee gives no public noticoof the salo, and lnthough hoe purohases the stock at the sale, yet tlhe pledger rat- i ies tle stlo by acquiescing id by nego- tiating to buy tih stock. lill v. Finigan, 77 Cal. 207 (1888). The statute of lim. itations is no bar to an action to redeem a pledge of stock, unless the statute was set running by demand of payment and notice of intent to sell. Gilmer v. Morris, 85 Fed. Rep. 082 (1888). See c., 80 Ala. 78. In the case of a pledge of stock to securo future advances, the statute of limitations begins to run against the right of the pledgor to re. deem from the time when the pledgee, by some positive act, repudiates the pledge and claims the property as his own, or improperly disposes of it. Gil- mer t: Morris, 43 Fed. Rep. 450 (1800). If the pledge is recognized by extension to other debts, the statute of limita- tions runs from the latterdate. Gilmer v. Morris, 40 Fed. Rep. 883 (1891). This case, Gilmer v. Morris, 80 Ala. 78, arose again in Billing v. Gilmer, 00 Fed. Rep. 832 (1894), rev&#x0027;g Gilmer v. Billings, 55 Fed. Rep. 775.

Berdell, 24 Hun, 870 (1881). Wlhere stock pledged to secure a note is to be transferred as payment in case the note Is not paid, the pledgee may sue on the note if the pledgor has not trans- ferred the stock. Fullerton v.

Misrepresenta- tions by a pledgee of stock as to the value of the stock,made after its pledge, are no defense for the pledgor when sued on the debt. Palmer v.

			mnado t theor, and tile stock is in a small Massachusetts corporation and is not known elsewhero, it is unraosonablo for the pledgee to fix tlh place of sale in New York, oven though the pledgoo is a Now York corporation; but whero tile pledgor, on receiving notice of the propose(l sale, (ldos not mako any protest or objection to the place of sale, and takes no action whatsoever in regard to it, tho pledgor waives any objection on this account.&#x0027; The time between the service of the notice and the time when tile sale is to take place must be reasonablo in longth, so as to give tile debtor an opportu- nity to obtain money to pay tlh debt.&#x0027; Four (lays&#x0027; notice is sulil- cient, although the sale is made in New York and the ple(lgor resides in lloston.3 A notice by a newspaper advertisement is insufficient.4 It is not sullicient notice to the pledgor to send himn a printed copy of the public notice of sale, the pledged stock being inclulded in a largo amount of other stock, and there being nothing to indicate an intent to sell nor to indicate that the pledgor was interestedl. Tlhe notice must be served personally, and it seems that it cannot be served on one who has charge of the pledgor&#x0027;s ollico for tile transaction of business.0 A sale of bonds as collateral Schouler, Bailm., 2d ed., § 220. It has beon helul in Maryland that a notice of tho place is unnecessary. Worthington v. Tormey, 34 IMd. 183 (170). But such decision would be unsafe, and probably would not be followed elsewhere. 1 Guinzburg tr H. WV. Downs Co., 105 Mass. 407 (1800).

Y. 232, holding that two days was sufficient: Stevens tv Hurlbut Bank, 31 Conn. 140 (186&#x0027;), holding that a sale on the same day is unreasonable and the notice in- sufficient. See other cases in g: 457, 458, supra; Willoughby v. Comstock, 3

Such notice did not give the defendant an opportunity to redeem the property or save his equity. Jacoby v. S. Jacoby &#x0026; Co., 103 Fed.

In this case a third party lad substituted his stock for tho stock of the original pledger, and the court held that the substituted stock was subject to the terms of the original agreement of pledge as to mode of sale. A private sale in accordance with the contract allowing said sale was held in Dullnig v. Weekes, 40 S. W.

Tle court held also that a waiver of advertisement or notice waived any notice to the pledger and also to the public. See also § 477, supra. Where the pledger becomes insolvent and assigns for the benefit of creditors, his assignee may agree with the pledgee that the stock be sold at private sale by the assignee. Durfee t.

A pledgee is not justified in selling the pledge for just enough money to pay the debt where the pledge is known to have more than double that value, and where the pledgee, although a bona fldc holder, had learned that the pledge had been made in breach of trust by the pledgor, especially where the pledgee buys at the sale.

			voitdable.- It is a woll-established rule that, weoroe a pledge pur- Hces the remedy of solling tho stock upon notice, the plodgee him- self is disqualified from purchasing bilo stock.&#x0027; Tlel rule is based on tile principlo that tlh pledgee owes a duty to the ploedgor, annt will not open tho door to possible devices of the pledgee for pur. chasing tlh stock for himsolf at a low price. T&#x0027;ll pledgee cannot iprcliaso, oither directly or indirectly, in his own name or in tih inamii of another.2 Tlle oeect of a purchaso by tho pledgee for liinsolf is that til whole proceeding of the plolgeo for subjecting thl plodgo to tho paylment of tho debt is utterly futile, and void- able at tho election of the pledgor.

Where a pledgee bank having a right to sell at private sale and without notice sells the pledge through its president, who buys the pledge himself, and the president openly pays the bank for it, long delay
			on the part of the bank in complaining is fatal. Raymond v. Palmer, 41 La. Ann. 425 (1889). Even though the at- torney for the pledgee buys a pledge at public sale and afterwards resells it to the pledgee, yet if there is no proof that the transaction was a mere device the sale is valid.

Where a bank holds $300,000 of first-mortgage bonds issued to the bank by the corporation itself, for a debt of about $175,000 and tranls sers the same to another party, who ad- vertises and sells the bonds under the terms of the pledge, even though the purchaser borrows the money from the bank in order to make payment, the sale is not thereby invalidated.

Tho pledge relationship continues as though no nttempt had been nnade by the plodgoo to subject tho pledge to tho paynltent of tho debt.1 Where tile pledgoo buys tle security at the publio sale nnd then sells it, and thon sues tho pl)eogor for the dolloioncy on tho first sale, tho pledgor may olaim u sot-off for the full value of tho securities wrongfully resold, and the return of the same and offers to perform his part of tho contract; but whore the plledgeeo sols a part of the property lio is liable for conversion without any demand or offer of por- formanco by the pledgor. Glidden v. Moolhanics&#x0027; Nat. Bank, 53 Ohio St. 088 (1895). Wlhor the plodgee purchases at the sale tie salo is void, but does not amount to a conversion of the secu. rities. First Nat. Bank v.

Even though a national bank, as pledgee of a national bank stock which

Robinson v. Southern, etc. Bank, 180 U. a. 215(1001). Whore the pledgee of stock sells it out and buys it in himself, and at the an- .nual election votes tho stock by proxy, even though the stock still stands on tie corporation books in tie name of tie pledgor, and the pledgor claims that tie sale is illegal and that the di- rectors elected by tile pledgee&#x0027;s vote in- tend to take action detrimental to the corporation, such pledgor is entitled to an,injunction against such directors acting ns directors. Reynolds v. Bri- denthal, 57 Neb. 280 (1898). A purchaser of stock who makes a partial payment and gives back the stock as collateral security cannot abandon the contract and claim such part of the stock as tih payment already made would pay for, on the ground tlat the seller has ob- tained control of tle corporation and is guilty of a breach of trust. Tle fact that the seller as pledgee has sold tile stock and bought it in himself is im- material, inasmuch as such a sale is illegal. Reid v. Caldwell, 110 Ga. 481 (1900). Where the trustee of a mort- gage makes a loan to the mortgagor on the bonds secured by tle mortgage and then sells out tle collateral and buys it in himself, lie can upon foreclosure en- force the bonds only to the extent of the amount loaned and interest.

			OHAPTER XXVIL LEVY OF ATTACHMENT AND EXECUTION UPON SHARES OF STOCK. § 480. An execution at common lawn

			equity subject stock to the paymont ot debts, except when it had been conveyed away fraudulently. 482. By statutory provisions exeou-
			tions ate generally sumlcent to reach the debtor&#x0027;s stock - Strict compliance necessary. 483. Attachment of stock as allowed
			by the statutes of the various states 484. Levy of nttaclment or execution
			upon stock hleld in pledge or by trustee, and of stock which the debtor has fraudulently transferred away. 485. Can stock or certificates of stock
			be attached elsewhere than in the state creating the corpora- tion? 48 Rights of an unregistered trans-
			seree of a certillcate of stock as against an attachment or execution levied on that stock. 487. In New York, Pennsylvania,
			New Jersey, Michigan, Mlin- nesota, Missouri, Delaware, Nebraska, Tennessee, · Ken- tucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Washington, and in the federal courts passing upon the transfer of national-bank stock, it is held that by the
			common law tho unregistered transfereo of a cortillicto of stock is protected as agaiznst all subsequent attnolilients or executions levied on that stoolk. § 488. In Illinois, Maine. Maryland,
			Massachlusetts, Now 1lamp- shliro, lthodo Island, Virginia, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and Wyoming, tlh statutes have prescribed that an un- registered purchaseror pledgeo. of certiflcates of stook shall be protected against subsequent nttachments or executions levied upon that stock. 489. Rights and duties of the corpo-
			ration in such cases. 400. In Alabama, Arkansas, Califor-
			nia, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Now MBexico, and Vermont, the usual stat- utes requiring transfers of stock to be registered on the corporate books are so con. strued as to give an attach- ment or execution precedence over a prior unregistered sale or pledge of the certificates of stock - Notice of transfer without registry. 491. Shares of stock cannot be sub.
			jected to the payment of the stockholder&#x0027;s debts by the process of garnishment unless the statutes so provide. § 480. An execution at common law could not rcach shares of stock.- A share of stock is in the nature of a chose in action, and at common law a chose in action could not be reached by or made subject to a levy of execution. Consequently it has been uniformly held by the courts that at common law a levy of execution could not be made on shares of stock. Unless, therefore, the process of execution has been extended by statute so as to reach such prop- erty, the stock of a judgment debtor cannot be made subject to the payment of his debts by means of an execution.&#x0027; An attach- iVan Norman v.

Nor, it seems, could a court of&#x0027;cquity sutlject stolk to the )myr/lunt of d1ebts, cxcelt lwhen it had beln coneeyed away Jframlu lently/.-Thiore is somee doubt whotlher a court of equity has power to subject a judgment debtor&#x0027;s ohoses in action to the payment of his debts, whore the only ground for the interference of the court is that, unless it docs interfere, such property cannot be reached by tile judgment creditor. In New York, previous to the statutes regulating this subject, tlhe jurisdiction of a court of equity therein was omphatically denied in ono case,&#x0027; and with equal emnphasis de- clared to exist in another ease.&#x0027; Thl English authorities are quito uniform in liolding that a court of equity has no such jurisdiction.4 And in America, for theo most part, a similar conclusion is arrived Daniel v: Gold Hill, etc. Co., 08 Pno.

FIrequontly special pro- visions are made applicaboe to stock, and prescribing tile steps which are necessary to render the levy of execution effectual. Whore an oxeoution is levied in accordance with such statutes, its provisions must be substantially complied with, and, if not com- plied with, the sale is not merely, voidable, but is wholly unauthor- ized and void. The mode of sale is particularly scrutinized by the courts.3 It is fatal to the levy and sale if the sheriff fails to give nry interest in an annuity. In Horn v. defendant. Hyatt rt Swivel, 52 N. Y. Ilorn, Ambl. 70 (1740), the court refused Super. Ct. 1 (1885).

Even though the sheriff sells in one lot a large block of stock under execution instead of dividing and selling it in small lots, and even though such sale realizes $12,000, wheroas the levy was for only $1,000, yet the purchaser is protected in his purchase. Connecticut, etc. Ry. v. Morris, 14 S. C. Rep. (Can.) 818 (1887).

			§ 483. Attachment of stock as allowzed by the statutes of 17t vari- ous states.- The states of the Union have quite generally passed statutes providing for the attachment 6f a debtor&#x0027;s property where the debtor is a non-resident or is guilty of a fraud, or where other facts exist which bring the case within the attachment statute. Inasmuch as in modern times a large part of the property of in- dividuals consists of shares of stock in corporations, the attach- ment statutes generally provide specially for the attachment of stock, and give specific directions in reference to the steps neces- sary to be taken in making such attachment.7 In New York an &#x0027; Titcomb i. Union M. &#x0026; F. Ins. Co., 8 Mass. 826 (1811), and Howe v. Stark- weather, 17 Mass. 240 (1821), where the sale was made after the proper day, without a re-advertisement, and conse- quently was held to be void. The court said: "The sale of them upon execu- tion not being justifiable at common law, the statute must ba striotly pur. sued to give any property to the pur- chaser." An execution sale of stock at nine o&#x0027;olook at night, when few are present, is void. MoNaughton v. Me. Lean, 73 Mioh. 250 (1889). 2Morgan v Thames Bank 14 Conn. 09 (1840)

			§ 484.. Levy of attachmelnt or executio ,n uponb stoc;k h 7d in pledtgo or by trustee, and on stock which the debtor Ihas J&#x0027;fraudulently trans- Jbrred awau!l.--Whlther or not an execution can be levied on stock which has boon fraudulently transferred away by the judgment debtor depends upon the wording of the statute allowing the levy of execution on stock. If it allows a levy on all interests of the debtor, whether legal or,equitable, then the fraudulent transfer may be disregarded and the stock seized as though still standing in tlhe nann of the judgment debtor.&#x0027; If, however, the statute does not oxprcssly provide for a levy on an equitable interest, the judg- ment creditor&#x0027;s renmedy is not an execution, but a suit in equity to set aside the fraudulent transfer.2 So also an attachment may be levied on shares of stock when the words of the attachment statute are so broad as to render subject to the attachment all equitable interests of the debtor whoso stock is attached. In many of the states where the debtor has transferred his stock for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, an attachment may be levied on the stock.&#x0027; The judgment creditor may also institute a suit in equity to set aside the fraudulent trtnsfor and subjeot the stock to the payment of the judgment.4 Under the usual statutes, an attach- ment or execution may be levied upon stock, where the stock has been mortgaged or pledged, and the attaching creditor is seeking to reach merely the equity of redemption.&#x0027; An injunction against l Scott v.

Dividends on the stock which is attacled follow tio stock, andl are covered by the attachment.3 An attachment on stock staud- ing on the books in a debtor&#x0027;s nano is not good where it is slown that in fact he held the stock as trustee for another.&#x0027; Even though It partnership allows stock owned by it to stand on the books of the company in the namo of one of the partners, yet an attachment :igiinit him and levied on such stock does not give tho attaching creditor priority over the rights of the partnership.&#x0027; Where the stock lias be.n transferred on the corporate books to a pledgee, and after- wards the debt has been paid, the stock cannot be attached for debts duo from the pledgee.&#x0027; There can be no attachment of stock as the property of an unregistered holder through whom title has gage is recorded on the corporate books, notice must be served on the mortgagee also; and that, where one attachment was served on the corporation and an- other on the mortgagee, the latter at- tachment prevails and takes the sur- plus; Norton v.

Long delay is not a bar so long as the agent does not deny the agency or trusteeship. Hovey v. Bradbury, 112 Cal. 020 (1890).

It is true that, for purposes of taxation and soino other similar purposes, stock follows tho domicile of its owner; but, considered as proporty soparated from its owner, stock is in existence only in the state of the corporation.

See § 5732, infra. As to the valid- ity of a trau.,fer of stock made in one state, while the corporation issuing the stock is located in another state, the rule applies "that personal property

			§ 48(1 tights of an mnrliristeredl trl.(ns/reo of a certliJloato of .stok (ol&#x0027; (af!lnitst a.n attflaclhmlt or exooetioi. Ietid oll that stoc1,.- Tlhe most lilllcult and unsettled question connected with an attach- ment or execution levied on stock is the question of how far a pur- chaser of the certillcato of stock from the stockholder and debtor is protected in his ownership wheor such purchasor does not havo his transfer registered on tile corporato books before the attach- ment or execution is levied. The question is especially important, since it af&#x0027;ects the rights of a bona ,/fde purchaser of stock in the open market, and constitutes one of the greatest dangers incurred in tile purchase of certificates of stock. It has been hold that if a stockholder whoso stock has been already attached or sold on cx- ecution sells his certilicato of stock after the levy of such attach- ment or executioil :ie vendlco or transforco buys subject to sucll levy, even though lie hlad no knowledge of it. The stock, in con- templation of law, has already been seized by the levy, and tl!e purchaser is bound to take notice of that fact.&#x0027; The only means of avoiding this danger in the purchaso of stock is by an inquiry at the office of the corporation at the time of making the purchase.2
			A different question, however, presents itself when tho stock- holder against whose stock ;ln attachment or execution is levied has already and before such levy sold and transferred his certili- cate of stock, but that transfer has not been registered on the cor- porate books. The courts of the different states arc in irreconcil- able conflict on this question of whether tho unregistered trans- ferce is protected in his purchase. The better rule, and the rule whicl ultimately will prevail, is that an unrecorded. transfer of stock is in this respect like an unrecorded (leed of land, and gives good title as against subsequent attachment or executions, oven business men as property for all prac- 85 Tenn. 180 (1880); Chesapeake, etc. tical purposes They nre sold in the R.

In Now York, Pe1llm/!llvaltia, Ntwa J&#x0027;rsey, 2Michigall, Mlin- nesotas, Missouri, DDelaware, Nebraska, Toinlotssae, Keltucky, lottis- la(a, Mlississilpi, Texas, Wl&#x0027;ashington, (til in the .&#x0027;ak(cral courts passi.il trlponi t( tr-llqtfr oft&#x0027; ntionall bank stock, it is held that by th( common law1 t1he0 unreistr/l.sc trallS.ieo of a ce(rltficclt of stock is protected as agatnst all subsequent attachmelcnts or excoltions

Such is the rule prevailing in the federal courts and in the courts of the above-named states.&#x0027; FrequcntLy this rule is justilied and explained on the ground that registry and by-laws or charter pro-
			iVNci Y&#x0027;ork: Tie caso of Smith t. Amerloan Coal Co., 7 Lans. 817 (1873), fully discusses and sustains this rule. See also Do Conoeau v. Guild Sari Oil Co., 8 Daly, 218 (1870), where the court says that tile sheriff, "by the levy of such an attnchmlent, could not acquire any better or greater title to the stock than a person would have donoe wiho had purchased this stock of the person in whose name it stood on the day of thle levy of the attachment, And the principle is well settled in this state that such a purchaser would not ac- quire any interest whatever as against a prior purchaser for value." Where the corporation causes an attachment to be levied on the stock of a stock- holder of record who has sold his cer- tificates to another person and causes a sale to be made to deprive the latter of his stock, hle may hold the corpora- tion liable. Robinson v. Now Berne Nat. Bank, 05 N. Y. 037 (1884!; Sims r. Bonner, 10 N. Y. Supp. 801 (1891). See also, in general, Dunn v. Star F. Ins. Co., 10 N. Y. Week. Dig. 531 (1884). An assignment of the certificates to a re- ce&#x0027;ver In another state takes prece-
			denco of an attachment against tih stock at the home of the corporation. The court will direct the corporation to register the transfer. Wollor v. Pace Tobacco Co., 5 Ry. &#x0026; Corp. L.

When the transferrer notifies the corpo- ration of the transfor, a subsequent at- tachment of the stock as the property of the transferrer is not good, although the transfer was not recorded in the corporate book.

			visions requiring registry of transfers on the corporate books are not for the purpose of notifying tlh credoitors of the old registered stockholder that lio no longer owns the stock, nor for any similar purpose, but are for the purpose of protecting tho corporation in )pying dividends and allowing tlh stock to be voted.

Lund v. Wheoton, etc. Co, 00 Minn. 80 (1890) Tho court so hold al- though the statute prescribed that no transfer should be valid except as be- tween the parties until suolc transfer was registered on the corporate books. Under the MIinnesota practice, whele a corporation issued for refusal to transfer stock whiol is claimed on one hand by a purchnsor of the certifcato and on tlh other by a purchaser at an execution sale, the clnimant intervenes. Haslam v. First Nat. Bank, etc., 79 Minn. 1 (1000). Missouri: MecClintock v. Central Bank, 120 Mo. 127 (184). In this case it was held that an atl! iling creditor cannot complain that the pledgee, who has prior rights, settled with the pledgor after the attachment and then sold the stock. The creditor must offer to redeem or have a sale subject to the pledge. The pledgee of the certificates was the corporation itself. In Mer- chants&#x0027; Nat. Bank v. Richards, 0 Mo. App. 451 (1879), application had been made to the corporation for registry, but had been refused. The purchaser of a certificate of stock in a Missouri corporation may maintain a bill in equity for injunction to prevent the corporation transferring such stock to one who purchased the same at execu- tion sale on a judgment obtained against the registered holder of such stock, it being shown that such pur-

			chaser at executlon sale took with no. tice of the prior sale of the crtificate. Selllgmian i St. Louls, etc. RI, I, 22 Fed. liep. 80 (1884), Delaware: In Delaware the purchaser of a certificate of stock is protected as against attaclhmolnts for debts of the transforrer, even though he does not havo the stock transferred on the cor- porato books, and he may have an in- junction against such attaching cred- itor selling the stock on execution. Allon t. Stewart, 7 Del. Oh. 287 (180). In Trimblo v. Vandegrift, 7 IIoust. 451 (1887), the court ordered stock to be sold on an execution, although the cor- poration stated at the time of the at- tachment that it had received notice that the stock had already been sold. It appeared, however, that the state. ment made by the corporation did not tell to whom the sale-had been made, and did not state that a transfer had been made on the corporate books, and it appeared also that the attaching creditor had no way of testing his right to priority, unless the sale was al- lowed to take place, and that the sale would not necessarily cut off the right of the hol ier of the certificate of stock to litigate the priority of his title. In Wilmington, etc. Turnp. Co. v. Bush, 1 Harr. 44 (1832), the court held that the company could not defend against a suit for dividends on the ground that attachment lhad been levied against the stock as the property of a former registered owner of the stock, it appear- ing that the corporation had issued new certificates of stock without a trar jser on the books being made by the former owner of the stock.

Even though a pledgee who holds the certificates in- dorsed in blank sends them to tie plodgor to be executed for now certifi. cates in a consolidated company, and even though the pledgor takes out such now certificates in his own name, yet
			this is not a waiver of the podgRo onl- titling attauolilg creditors of tih pledgor to precedenco over tle pledgee.

The court said: "The tendency of modern decisions is to regard certificates of stock attached to an executed blank assignment and power to transfer as approximating to negotiable securities, though neither in form or character negotiable."

The case of People&#x0027;s Bank v.

The statute was passed in 1883 to change this rule. Rice v. Gil- bert, 173 111. 848 (1898). ilaine: Laws of 1807, chapter 203. In this state the statute formerly pre- scribed that no title should pass by sale of the certificates except as between the parties until registry had been had eu the corporate books.

			which places an attacbment or execution levy ahcnad of an unreg- istered purchaser of the certificate of stock. The evil consequences of the rule, however, seem to have bncome apparent to lhr courts, and it was hold that, although the unregistered purchaser was not protected where the charter of the corporation required registry,&#x0027; yet, where only the by-laws or the certificate itself created such a requirement, tiho unregistered purchaser was protected and took precedence over thb attachment or execution.2 Tho IJgislature of Massachusetts seems to have had a still.clearer perception of the doemands of trade and of tho interests of those who invest in cer- tiflictos of stock, and in 1884 enacted a statute which makes an at- tachment or execution levied on stock no more effective than in New York state.3 Similar statutory changes have been made in the other states mentioned above.
			§ 489. Ilights ald d(lties of the corporation in such7 cases.--Tho corporation has a dangerous duty to perform when stock has been attached or sold under levy of execution, and a registry is requested though one of its directors know of a prior unregistered sale of the certifi- cates of stock; such director, however, having taken no part in levying the at- tachment. The case of Scripture v. Francestown Soapstone Co., 50 N. H. 071 (1871), held that the attachment was not good as against a prior pur- chaser of the certificate of stock from the president himself, inasmuch as the president&#x0027;s knowledge of the sale was sufficient notice to the corporation it- self. See also Stowe v. Meserve, 13 N.H. 46 (1842) 2Rode jsland: Chapter 690, Laws 1888 Virginia: Code of 1887, sec. 1133. IlVest Virginia: Section 37. chapter 53, Code 1887.

			by the purchaser at such sale or by a purchaser of the outstanding ccrtiflclte of stock. If the purchaser of the certificate demands registry before registry has been allowed to the purchaser at the execution sale, and if the former claims to have purchased the eer- tificate before the attachment or execution was levied, the right of the corpor:tion is clear. It may refuse to allow the registry, and when sued therefor may interplead and compel the claimants to litigate the matter between themselves.&#x0027; Iut where the corpora- tion does not know whether the outstanding certificate is in the hands of a purchaser or not, and a registry is demanded by a pur- chaser at an execution sale, the rights and duties of the corporation are not so clear. It has two courses open to it: it may refuse to allow a registry until compelled to do so by a court, or it aray allow registry without being so compelled. The former is the safer course, since the corporation will probably be thereby pro- tected from all liability to a possible purchaser of the outstanding certificate.2 The corporation should be protected in its obedience to the decree of a court.3 It is quite probable, also, that no court in any of the above-named states would require the corporation to issue new certificates of stock to a purchaser of stock at an execu- tion sale, unless such purchaser give to the corporation a bond of indemnity, whereby an unknown purchaser of the outstanding cer- tificate may be protected.4 The other course open to the corpora- 1 See § 387, supra. The proper remedy for the purchaser from the judgment debtor to pursue under such circum- stances is to enjoin the corporation and the purchaser at the execution sale from registering the latter as a stock- holder. Smith v. Crescent City, etc. Co., 30 La. Ann. 1378 (1878). See also cases sq)pra. If an attachment has been levied he should enjoin that. Cheever v. Meyer, 52 Vt. 00 (1879). 2 "Where a judicial tribunal of com- petent jurisdiction of last resort; after a fair contest in good faith by the cor- poration, orders the stock to he trans- ferred to the purchaser under such seiz- ure and sale, the corporation cannot be liable to the holder of the certificate who took no steps to protect himself." Friedlander v. Slaughter House Co., 31 La. Ann. 523 (1879). Where, also, the unregistered transferee contested in the courts the right of the purchaser at the execution sale, and was defeated in
			the lower court, and appealed without staying the decree below, the corpora- tion is not liable for obeying the decree of the lower court, although the appeal is successful. Chapman v. New Orleans, etc. Co., 4 La. Ann. 153 (1840. See Rob- inson I. New Berne Nat. Bank, 95 N. Y. 637 (1884). 3See §8 361,388, supra. Cf. §330, supra. 4The supreme court of Ohio, in New London Nat. Bank v. Lake Shore, etc. Ry., 21 Ohio St. 221 (1871), very properly and very distinctly refused to compel a - registry, although conceding that the execution purchaser is entitled to divi- dends. The court said: "Can it be that, because the defendant refused to as- sume the peril of deciding between the contending claimants by issuing other certificates for the same stock to the plaintiff upon demand, that it thereby became a wrong-doer and converted the plaintiff&#x0027;s stock to its own use, and rendered itself liable to respond in the 1011 Oll.

			tlon, that of allowing a registry by the purchaser at Lth execution sale without being compelled to do so by a court, is pursued by the corporation at its peril. If it afterwards transpires that the out- standing certificato had been purchased before the attachment or execution was levied, the corporation is liable in damages to buch purchasor for allowing the registry,&#x0027; but not unless such purchaser gave a valuable consideration for the certificate and alleges that fact in his pleadlig.2 Until such purchaser demands a registry from tllo corporation, it may safely pay dividends to the execution purchaser.s ilftatndamnu lies to compel a corporation to transfer stock sold under levy of execution. It can be granted as a conl- mon-law remedy or as a remedy ancillary to the suit.&#x0027; This rule, however, would work harshly in states where the purchaser of the outstanding certificate may have some rights. Where such a pos- sibility exists the mantamlts should be denied.5 A judgment cred- itor&#x0027;s execution lien on bank stock is subject to the lien of the cor- poration itself by statute on the stock for debts due to it from the judgment debtor, and a further statutory provision that the en- forcement of the corporation&#x0027;s lion shall not affect attachment or execution liens goes merely to the remedy and does not affect the priority.6
			Where the transferee of certificates of stock in a bank presents them to the cashier of the bank for transfer, and the cashier and a director delay transfer until a debt of the transferrer to the bank becomes due, and then in behalf of the bank levy an attachment on the stock for such debt, the transferee may hold the bank and full value of the stock to the claimant who could establish his right in a court of law? The mere statement of the proposition refutes it." As to the mode of pleading that the defendant com- pany has been compelled to transfer the stock to a purchaser at an execu- tion sale. see Wyoming Fair Assoc. v. Talbott, 3 Wyo. 244 (1889). I Smitlh v. American Coal Co., 7 Lans 317(1873). If the purchaser at the exe- cution sale still has the certificates, the purchaser of the old certificate may bring suit against him and the corpo- ration to compel a retransfer. Rogers v. New Jersey Ins. Co., 8 N. J. Eq. 167 (1840). In a suit by a purchaser at an execution sale to cut off the rights of a judgment debtor the corporation is an indispensable party, since it alone can

			§ 490. In Alabama,, Arkansoas, California, Colorado, Connecti- ct, Indiana, lowua, New Mexico, and Vermont, the usuYl statutes requirig transfers of stock to be registered on the corlorate books irre so construed as to give an attachlment or execution pr1ecedenco orer a lprior unregistered sale or lled!l, of the certiJicttes of stoolk - Notice of transfer without registry.- The courts of these states all hold that, where a statute exists requiring a transfer or stock to be registered on the corporate books in order to be effectual, an at- I Hine v. Ccmmercial Bank, etc., 110 Mlich. 448 (1800). 2Biiley v. Stroheoker, 88 Gn. 250 (.&#x0027;,08). Where the attachment is on stock that; the plaintiff alleges was transferred in fraud of creditors, main- damus will not lie to compel the corpo- ration to allow a registry under the ex- ecution sale.

			seree. Fahrney v. Kelly, 102 Fed. Rep. 403 (100). See also § 482, siupra. b Alabama: By statute the attach- ment takes precedence over a prior transfer of the certificates, where sach transfer is not recorded on the corpo- rate books within fifteen days. Berney Nat. Bank v. Pinckard, 87 Ala. 577 (1888); Dittey t. First Nat. Bank, 113 Ala. 391 (1896. Under this statute the unregistered pledgee is not protected against attachments, but notice to the corporate officer of the attachment may be oral. Abels v. Planters&#x0027;, etc Co., 92 Ala. 882 (18ó). In Fisher v. Jones, 82 Ala. 117 (1886), the court held tlhat the unregistered pledgee was pro, tected where there was an entry made on the stub of the certificate book of the stock being held in pledge. Under this statute the attaching creditor takes title in preference to an unreg- istered transferee, and the same rule prevails where the registered holder is a mere "dummy " for another. White v.

Under the Arkansas statute it is immaterial that the pur- chaser at the execution sale had actual knowledge that the debtor had trans. ferred the stock, and it is immaterial that the attachment was due to an ar- rangement between the corporation, a creditor, anda debtor. Fahrney v. Kelly. 102 Fed. Rep. 403 (1900). The Arkansas statute requiring transfers of stock to be recorded with the county clerk does not apply to a pledge of stock. Batesville, etc. Co. v. Myer, etc. Co.. 68 Ark. 115 (1900). In the case of Masury v. Arkan- sas Nat. Bank, 93 Fed. Rep. 003 (1899), the court in a carefully reasoned opin- ion decided that the Arkansas statute requiring a transfer on the corporate books as against creditors of the vendor of stock did not apply to a pledge of stock, even though such pledge was made by transferring and delivering the certificate of stock without any rec- ord whatsoever on the corporate books. The court stated that it was unneces- sary for it to pass on the question of whether public notice of the pledge given at the execution sale had any

			bIearing upon tle rights of tihe pur- chaser. The court sald: "It is a well known fact that stool certilicates fre- quently circulato il places far remote from the homo of the corporation by wliolh they wore issued, tihat in all comnmercial centers they aroe olumonly transferred from Iand to hand like ne. gotiable paper, and that they are hy- pothecated for temporary loans by a sil.. pie indorsement and delivery thereof, the latter being perhaps tie most conm- non use to whilch such securities are put. In the great majority of cases, when stock is merely pledged for a loan, no record of the transfer is made on the books of the corporation, and in the judgment of laymen the mrauing of such a record seems to be a needless formality. The trend of modern te- cisions lhas been to encourage the free circulation of stock certificates in the mode last indicated, on the theory that they are a valuable aid to commercial transactions, and that the public inter- est is best subserved by removing all restrictions against their circulation and by placing them as nearly as pos- sible on the plane of commercial paper." Californ-ia: In this state the statute prescribes that "no transfer of stock .hl::il be valid for any purpose what- ever . . . until it shall be entered" on the corporate books. Under this statute an attachment takes preced- ence over an unrecorded prior transfer of a certifcate of stock. See Weston t.

Elinore, 85 Cal. 003 (1808). If the unregistered purchaser buys tlhe judgment obtained under thle ttaoh. minot, tile latter is merged. Stvout v. Natomv. Water, etc. Co., 0 Cal. 78 (1808), A sale of stock after an attachment suit has failed, and before that decision is reversed, gives the purchasor good title. Loveland v. Alvord, etc. Co., 70 Cal. 502 (1888). A transaction whereby a debtor delivers certificates of stock to its creditor in pledge, and the ored. itor immediately returns them to the debtor, is not a valid pledge, even though the debtor told the corporate olllcers of the pledge, but said he did not want the transaction to appear on the hooks, and even though the secre- tary makes a note of the fact on the stubs of the certificate-of-stock book. An execution subsequently levied upon the stock as the property of the debtor takes precedence over the alleged pledge. MoFall v. Buckeye, etc. Assoc., 122 Cal. 408 (1898). In California the purchaser at execution sale, without notice of a prior sale of the certificates, is entitled to the stock and to have now certificates issued to him. even though the old certificates are out- standing. West Coast, etc. Co. v. Wulff, 133 Cal. 815 (1901). Colorado: In this state the statute prescribes that "no transfer of stock shall be valid for any purpose what- ever . . . unless it shall have been entered" on the corporate books within sixty days from the date of such trans- ser. See Conway j. John, 14 Colo. 80 (1800), giving a preference to the at- tachment. Cf. Weber v. Bullock, 19 Colo. 214 (1893), holding that the pledgee was protected where he had requested transfer and been wrongfully refused by tile corporation. See also Supply
			1( Ditch Co. v. Elllott, 10 Cole. 827 (1887). Where a statute requires a transfer on the books within sixty days, and the transfet is not made within those sixty days, an attaching creditor of the trals. ferrer takes title, even though lie knew of the unregistered transfer. First Nat. Bank, etc. v. Hastings, 7 Colo. App. 129 (18905. Where the purchaser of a cer- tificate of stock files a bill in equity to enjoin an attaching creditor of the transferee from selling the stock on execution, and joins the corporarimon as a party defendant, and in the suit the court decides that the stock was origi- nally legally issued, this decision is binding, even though it was not raised bythe pleadings. Nwman v. Bullock, 28 Colo. 217 (1800). Connecticut: See Northrup v. Curtis, 5 Conn. 240 (&#x0027;1824); Oxford Turnp. Co. v. Bunnel, 0 Conn. 552 (1827); Rich- mondville Mfg. Co. v. Prall, 9 Conn. 487 (1833); Dutton v. Connecticut Bank, 13 Conn. 493 (1840), where the recording of an assignment for the benefit of creditors in the probate office was held insufficient notice to the company as against attachments; Colt v. Ives, 31 Conn. 25 (1806), holding that, where a transfer. is wrongfully refused by the clerk, a subsequent attachmnent does not take precedence. The United States court sitting in Connecticut held in the case of New York Corn. Co. v. Francis, 83 Fed. Rep. 709 (1897), where stock in a Connecticut corporation stood on the books of the corporation in the name of a person who was really but a nominal holder for a copartner- ship, that an attachment levied on the stock as the property of such nominal holder was not good as against tlh real owner. The court distinguished such a case from a case where a purchaser allowed the stock to stand il the name of the vendor. The court sustained a (C11. XXVII,]

			nttachmernt or execution was levied, the purchaser of the outstand- ing certificate is entitled to the stock. If the attaching creditor lils notice bofore the attachment is levied, the purchaser may ob- bill in equity on tle part of the real owner of the stool to enjoin its sale on execution. lnituina: In this stato the statute prehcribing that stock should bo trans- forablo on the corporate books "and not otherviso" was hold to give pro- cedenco to an attachment us against unregistered purclacsers of cortificates of stock. Coloman v. Spencer, S Blalhf. 197 (1830) In State v. Jeffeorsoville Nat. Bank, 89 Ind. 303 (1883), tie court fell into the error that there could be no pledge of stock unless there was a trans- ser to the pledgee on the books of the company. Such of course is not the law. See § 403, supra. Moreover, the court did not consider the federal de- cisions on this subject, although ,-- tional-bank stock was involved. How. ever, the court held that the pledgee should have appeared and set up his claim. Iowa: In Iowa the statute prescribes that transfers shall not be valid except es between the parties until a registry is had on tle corporate books The court holds that this statute give an at- tachment priority over a prior unregis- tered sale or pledge of the certificates of stock. Fort Madison Lumber Co. v. Batavian Bank, 71 Iowa, 270 (1887). This case came up again in 1889, when it ap- pears that after the decision of the lower court in favor of the pledgee, and before reversal by the upper court, the lower court ordered a A.le and the pledgee bought in the stock, and after- wards the stock became worthless. Tle court now holds (77 Iowa, 393) that the pledgee need restore only the stock, although worthless. In Commercial Nat. Bank v. Farmers&#x0027;, etc. Bank, 82 Iowa, 102 (1891), the attaching creditor took no title because a statutory notice as to attachments was not given. In Iowa the attaching creditor has priority
			even though hie knew at the time of his attalcmoent that the cortifcateaof stock had been sold by his debtor and that notice thereof had been given to the corporation. Ottumlwn, etc. Co. . Stod- ghill, 103 Iowa, 437 (1807). Under the Iowa statute a transfer of stock is not effective as agailnt creditors, oven though a request has been made to the corporation to transfer the stock, if such transfer has not been made, and even though the corporation attaclled to the stub of the certificate an acknowl- edgment of the assignment of tile cer- tificate, and even though the attaching creditor knew of such request. Where the Iowa corporation keeps its stock books in Boston, a transfer on such books in Boston is not effective as against subsequent attachments on the stock in Iowa, unless a book is kept in Iowa shlowing all transfers as required by the statutes of Iowa. Perkins v. Lyons, 111 Iowa, 192 (1000. Where the purchaser of stock at execution sale ap- plies for a mandamus to compel the corporation totransfer the stock tohim, and the owner of the stock intervenes and claims thilt the debt on which the stock was sold had been paid, and asks for a delivery of the certificates to the owner, the case may be tried in equity. Croit v. Colfax, etc. Co., 113 Iowa, 45. (1001), holding also that even though a pledgee brings suit on a debt and levies on the stock he does not thereby lose his rights as pledgee. Compare § 47(. supra. The purchaser of a certificat of stock in a Missouri corporation may maintain a bill in equity for injunction to prevent the corporation transferring such stock to one who purchased tio same at execution sale on a judlgment obtained against the registered holdcr of such stock, it being shown that such purchaser at execution sale took with notice of the prior sale of the certifi- . 1010

			Where the unregistere(l transforeo of tle certillcate of stock lias notified tile corporation thereof and demanded registry, which is not grantc(e, any attachment or execution levied subsequently to the improper refusal by the corporation to register does not take precedence over such purchaser.2 If tlie corporation improperly refuses to allow the transfereo of stock to register his transfer, and the stock is afterwards attached by a creditor of the stockholder, the transferee may, if ho chooses, hold the corporation liable in damnages for its refusal to allow the registry.3 Whore the trans- seree of the certificate has repeatedly demanded a transfer of the company, but been refused, a subsequent attachment by a creditor of the transferrer does not take precedence, even though the stat- utes require a registry within sixty days.4 It is proper and legal for a corporation to add to the name appearing on the stock cer- tificate the words " as pledgee " or "as collateral security," or simi- lar words.5 Where the unregistered purchaser is cut off by an at- tachment, he cannot compel a purchaser from him to pay for the stoclk which is made valueless by tile attachment.2 Where the creditor of the vendor knows of the pledge of the certificates at the time he sells the stock on execution, he, the creditor, is not protected in&#x0027; such sale.

			It may be added, in regard to this whole subject, that the decis- ions and statutes of tho various states show clearly that public policy and the legitimate demands of trade have gradually caused the courts and legislatures of the various states to establish the rule that a salo or pledge of certificates of stock has precedence over a subsequent attachment levied on that stock for the debt of tlhe vendor or pledgor, and that the failure of tile pledgec or pur- chaser of the certillcate to obtain a registry on the corporate boolks is not fatal to his interest in the stock. In the great commercial centers, where certificates of stock pass from hand to hand and are pledged to banks and financial institutions daily to secure great sums of money, the necessity of such a rule is imperative; l and the fact that so many states have, by legislative enactment, adopted the New York rule, while no state has changed from the New York rule to the New England rule, demonstrates in itself the jus- tice and advisability of tile rule which prevails in New York state.
			In North Carolina 2 and North Dakota 1 the question of the prece- dence of attachments over unregistered sales or pledges of certifi- cates of stock has arisen only in an incidental way.
			§ 491. Shares of stock cannot be subjected to the payment of the stockhol7dr&#x0027;s debts by the process of garnishment unless the statutes so provide.-The process of garnishment is proper only where a debt is due from a third person to the defendant debtor. It is not a proper remedy for reaching shares of stock owned by the debtor.4 The corporation owes the stockhlolder no debt, and by no fiction of law can it be held to be a debtor of the defendant debtor. Conse- l Quoted and approved in Mapleton Bank r. Standrod, 71 Pac. Rep. 119 (Idaho, 1902). &#x0027;&#x0027;North Carolina: In Morehead v. Western N. C. R. R., 96 N. C. 302 (1887), there is a dictum to the effect that the attachment has precedence. There was no proof that the sale of the certificate was prior to the attachlient, and more- over the court said that the purchaser of the certificate might thereafter liti- gate his rights in another suit, inas- much as he was not a party to the suit at bar. 3 aorth Dakota: In Re Argus Print- ing Co., 1 N. Dak. 434, 444 (1891), there is a dictum giving priority toan uttach- ment. In Doty v. First Nat. Bank, 3 N. Dak. 9 (1892) the court declined to pass upon the question, inasmuch as na- tional-bank stock was involved, and the
			court followed the decisions of the fed- eral courts on this subject. In a decis- ion in Dakota territory the court held that where an attaching creditor knew of the priority of the certificates of stock le was not protected. Van Cise u Merchants&#x0027; Nat. Bank, 4 Dak. 485 (1887). 4 Planters&#x0027;, etc. Bank v. Leavens, 4 Ala. (N. S.) 753 (1843); Foster v. Potter, 37 Mo. 525 (1866); Ross v. Ross, 25 Ga. 297 (1858), where the court said: "Is stock in this railroad such a debt (in- debtedness) of the railroad to the stock- holder that a garnishing creditor of the stockholder can enter up judgment for it against the railroad? It is not; it is a debt which the railroad dares not pay, even to the stockholder himself. The road may pay him dividends on it, but that is all." 1019 C11. XXVII.]

			quently, where the sheriff levies an attachment, not according to procedure governing attachments, but according to the procedure of garnishment, the whole proceeding is void, and a subsequent transfer of the stock by the defendant debtor is valid.&#x0027; Stock hold as collateral is property subject to garnishment under the cta.utes of Texas.2 In Michigan garnishee process lies against the pledgee of stock in behalf of a creditor of the pledger, and en- ables the latter to reach the equity in the stock.&#x0027; Garnishee pro- cess lies to reach a stockholder&#x0027;s interest, under the statutes of Nebraska, especially whore the real interest of a registered stock- holder is different from his apparent interest.4 In Pennsylvania the equity of redemption which a pledgor has in stocks which he has pledged to a national bank may be reached by garnishment served on the bank after judgment against the debtor. The national bank act does not forbid such process.&#x0027; Even though&#x0027;garnishee process has been served upon the pledgee of stock for a debt of the pledger, yet the pledgor and pledgee may agree that the stock shall belong to the pledgee in cancellation of the debt. Such agreement is not illegal if the debt was the full value of the stock at the time; and even though subsequently the pledgee, upon selling the stock for more than the debt, pays the surplus to the pledger, the cred- itor issuing the garnishee process cannot complain.0 Garnishee pro- ceedings against a stockholder&#x0027;s interest in stock which has been pooled and has also been pledged does not affect such pool dr pledge, but is made subject to them if they are legal.7 Certificates of stock held by one party and belonging to another cannot be reached by garnishee process in behalf of a creditor of the owner of the stock. The certificate is merely "like a title deed or a bill of sale, which is not the property itself, but simply the evidence of title to property."8 1 Mooar v. Walker, 40 Iowa, 104 (1877). Cf. Chesapeake. etc. R. R. v. Paine. 29 Gratt. (Va.) 502 (1877). Garnishee pro- cess must conform to the statute rela- tive to attachments, and if served on the holders of the certificates instead of on the corporation it is ineffectual. Younkin v.

A corporate charter is a contract betwueen three parties- the state, the corporation, and the stockhol(ders.- The charter of a corporation having a capital stock is a contract between three par- ties, and forms the basis of three distinct contracts.&#x0027; The charter is a contract between the state and the corporation; second, it is a contract between the corporation and the stockholders; third, it is a contract between the stockholders and the state.
			§ 493. The charter as a contract between the corporation and the stockholders -Amendment of charter by majority of stockholders as allowed by statute existing at time ofq incorlporation.- That the charter is a contract between the corporation and the stockholders has within the last fifty years been firmly established, and is now 1 See State Bank v. Knoop, 16 hiow. 809 (1853); Port Edwards, etc. Ry. v. Arpin. 80 Wis 214 (1891); Northern R. R v. Miller, 10 Barb. 260 (1851); Cooley, Const. Lim. (5th ed.), p. 337, where the .learned author says: "Those charters of incorporation, however, which are granted, not as a part of tile machinery of the government, but for the private benefit or purposes of the corporators, stand upon a different footing, and are held to be contracts between the legis-
			lature and the corporators, having for their consideration the liabilities and duties which the corporators assume by accepting them; and the grant of the franchise can no more be resumed by the legislature, or its benefits dimin. ished or impaired without the consent of the grantees, than any other grant of property or valuable thing, unless the right to do so is reserved in the charter itself." 1021

			unquestioned law. The cases of Natusch v. Irving in England, and Livingston v. Lynch 1 in this country, followed by a long line of supporting decisions, distinctly hold that tlhe charter is a con- tract prescribing to the corporation that it shall not attempt to materially change, extend, alter, or abandon the particular business which that charter authorizes the corporation to do. Any attelpt of tile corporation to make such a change, extension, alteration, or abandonment of that business is called an ultra vires act. It is an act which a single stockholder may prevent by injunction or set asile by a suit in equity. This subject, however, is fully treated in another part of this work.3 Where the statutes in existence at the time of incorporation provide for the extension of corporate char- ters a stockholder cannot prevent the corporation from extentling its existence in accordance with such statutes.4 Under a statute authorizing the stockholders by an amended certificate to change the objects of the corporation, the certificate may be amended so as to give a corporation power to purchase stock in other corpora- tions.&#x0027; A holder of preferred stock may prevent a reduction of the preferred dividend by an amendment of the certificate of incor- poration, even though the statutes of the state at the time of the organization of the company authorize the certificate of corpora- tion to be amended by a certain vote. Such reduction may be enjoined.6
			§ 494. Charter as a coltract betceen the state and the corpora- tiont.- As between the state and the corporation the corporate charter is a contract, protected by that provision of the United States constitution which prohibits a state from passing any law which will impair the obligation of the contract.7 Hence it is 1 This case, decided by Lord Eldon in established.

			beyond the power of the state to repeal or materially annul such ai corporate charter, unless the power of amendment and repeal has boon expressly reserved by the state, or unless all the parties to the contract consent to the change. All the franchises, privileges, and express and implied powers necessary and essential to carrying out the corporate purposes are protected by this contract.&#x0027; This branch of the law is important to stockholders in cases whore the corporation neglects or refuses to protect itself against legislative amendmonts or repeals violating the charter contract between the corporation and the state. In such cases the stockholder mnay en- join or remedy the wrong by bringing an action in place of and on behalf of the corporation, making it a party defendant, to- gether with the parties who, under the authority of the state, have violated the contract.2 A stockholder&#x0027;s action to prevent the pay- mont of a tax&#x0027;levied upon the corporation in violation of a statu- tory exemption from taxation is an action of this character.3 Cor- porate charters, however, are subject to constitutional provisions enacted subsequently to the granting of the charters, unless tlere is a clear contract to the contrary.4 Although a special charter gives the right to a railroad corporation to consolidate with other roads, yet a subsequent general statute may take away this power except so far as the same has been already exercised."

			§ 497. Charter anlindmoitts impioscd IqU)o the stoc7ltholders..- The right of the legislature to amend a charter against the will of the stockholders has been the subject of much litigation. Such amendments are clearly divisible into two kinds. The first are those which, by their terms, are absolute and compulsory, and become a part of the charter irrespective of the action or willing- ness of the stockholders to accept them. Such amendlments, excepting those which are made as police regulations,&#x0027; are uncon- stitutional and void,l unless made under a reserved power to amend.&#x0027; Of such a kind are amendments repealing an exemption of stockholders from taxation.4 The legislature cannot compel a turnpike company to build a bridge beyond the turnpike as a con- dition of continuing to exorcise its franchise.5 Where a foreign railroad company has extended its lines into a state under a statute, the legislature of the latter state cannot afterwards require it to become a domestic corporation. Such a statute impairs the obliga- holders is held for settled law by the federal courts and by every state court in the Union. All the cases on the sub- ject are saturated with this doctrine. It is sustained not by a current but by a torrent of authorities. No judge who has a decent respect for the principle of stare decisis- that great principle which is the sheet-anchor of our juris- prudence - can deny that it is immov- ably established." "If anything is set- tled it is this rule of construction that a corporation takes nothing by its char- ter except what it is plainly, expressly, and unequivocally granted." Per Black, J., Bank of Pennsylvania v. Common- wealth, 19 Pa. St. 144 (1852). &#x0027;See § 900, infra. 2Such as an amendment changing the route and terminus. Ames v. Lake Superior, etc. R R, 21 Minn. 241 (1875). A corporate charter right to take a cer- tain rate of interest is a contract and is protected against subsequent legisla- tion.

			Philadelphia, etc. Ry.&#x0027;s Appeal, 102 Pa, St. 123 (1883), that an amendment to a charter which enlarges it witlout im- posing any new or additional burden upon it is a mere license and may be revoked, citing Johnson v. Crow, 87 Pa. St. 184 (1878); Christ Church tv Phila- delphia County, 24 How. 300 (1800). The legislature may subsequently au- thorize the sale of the corporate fran- chises, etc., to pay debts.

			[Oln. XXVxII. tion of the contract.&#x0027; Stockholders sued under the Minnesota stat- ute cannot question the amount of the assessment which has beon levied by the court. A statute to that effect is not unconstitu- tional.2 An amendment to a banking act whereby a lion is given to banks on stock of its stockholders for debts duo the bank from thllm does not apply to stock already issued.&#x0027; The Now Jersey statute prohibiting suits at law to enforce the statutory liability of stockholders in foreign corporations, and prescribing that the remedy shall be in equity only, is unconstitutional so far as liabilities ex- isting at the time of the passage of the statute are concerned.4 The legislature may authorize the statutory liability of stockholders to be enforced by a receiver, even in corporations which have passed into a receiver&#x0027;s hands prior to the enactment of the statute.1 But where, by statute, every creditor has the right to bring suit to en- force the stockholders&#x0027; liability, a statute taking away this right and giving it to a receiver is unconstitutional." So, also, a statute passed subsequently to the granting of a. charter, and increasing the liability of a stockholder on his stock for the debts already incurred, is unconstitutional and void unless the legislature has re- served the right to alter or amend the charter.7 Under such a 1 Commonwealth v Mobile, etc. .

And it is said that a stockholder may restrain by a proper proceeding the acceptance by the cor- poration of an unconditional amend. ment to the charter by which the lia- bility of the stockholders is increased.

			reservation the&#x0027; statute is legal and binding, although teoro are limits oven to this reserved power, as will be shown hereafter.&#x0027; A statute which authorizes an additional assessment upon existing paid-up stook is unconstitutional.2
			A statute imposing additional liability upon tho stockholders cannot be repealed so as to affect those who were corporate cred- itors previously to the repeal." But, whenever the statute impos- ing the liability is penal in its nature, a repeal of it, even so as to affect existing debts, is constitutional at any time before the cor- porate creditor obtains judgment on his olaim.4 An important ex- ception to the general rules stated above exists in regard to amend- ments under tho police power of the state. The state may amend the charter of a railroad corporation by reducing its traffllo charges, requiring it to build fences, and in various other ways for the pro- tection of the public.6 An amendment to a charter forbidding any made before the passage of such statute.

			consolidation with a competing line is a legitimate exercise of the police power of the state, and it is immaterial whether tile power to amend was reserved or not.&#x0027; It is constitutional for the legis- lature to require coal-mining companies to weigh coal before it is scroened, especially whore the legislature has reserved power to ameond charters.2 A statute requiring corporations to pay their employees once. a month, and giving the latter a lien prior to all lions excepting recorded mortgages, is unconstititional as being a grant of special privileges and as denying the corporation the equal protection of the laws, and as depriving them of their prop- erty without due process of law, in that such statute interferes with the freedom to make contracts.&#x0027;
			§ 498. Charter amenlodenits off&#x0027;redl to the stoc7k;7olders.- The sec- ond class of amendments to a charter-the amendments which occur most frequently and give rise to many difficulties - are those which allow the corporate directors or a majority of the stock- holders in corporate meeting assembled to engage in a new or dif- ferent or more extensive or more contracted business than that authorized by the original and unamended charter. This is the subject of the remainder of this chapter.
			§ 499. Auxiliar!y andt incidental oaendmcents are constitutional, though some of the stockholdoers dissent.- An amendment made to a corporate charter is either a material and fundamental change from the original plan, or it is an auxiliary and incidental change, consistent with the carrying out of the original plan.4 The latter class of amendments are constitutional and valid. The acceptance of an auxiliary amendment, however, should be by the stockholders 1Louisville, etc. .R . v. Kentucky, 161 U. S. 077 (1896). To same effect, Pearsall v. Great Northern Ry., 101 U. S. 646 (1896). 2A majority of the court, however, adopted the view that under the re- served right to amend charters the leg- islature must do so on terms that are just to the stockholders. Woodson t. State, 69 Ark. 521 (1900). 3Johnson v. Goodyear, etc. Co., 127 Cal. 4 (1899). To same effect, State v. Haun. 01 Kan. 140 (1899), rev&#x0027;g s. c, 7 Kan. App! 509. 4The general principle of law govern- ing this branch of the subject is well expressed in Woodfork v. Union Bank, 8 Coldw. (Tenn.) 488 (1800). "The con.
			tract or charter, after acceptance, is inviolable between the state and the corporation, as it is also between the corporation and stockholders. Neither the one nor the other can disregard its obligations or alter its essential fran- chises without the unanimous concur- rence of the stockholders. . . If the alterations proposed in the charter of a private corporation by legislative enactment are merely auxiliary and not fundamental, they may be ac- cepted by a majority of the corpora- tors; and when so assented to they are binding on the whole; but it is other- wise . . . when the alterations are fundamental, radical, and vital. The acceptance must then be unanimous." 1028

			in meeting assembled instead of by tho board of directors.&#x0027; 13ut acceptance may arise from user; 2 and hence it generally happens that an incidental or auxiliary amendment to a charter is deemed to have been accepted by user and a vote of acceptance by the directors or by user alone." An amendment may be said to be auxiliary and incidental when it merely grants new powers or au- thorizes new methods and new plans for tho purpose of carrying out the original plan and elfcting the real object of that plan. The individual motives and interests of a stockholder are disre- garded. Whatever is for the benefit of the corporation is conclu- sivoly presumed to be for the benefit of each stockholder. A change not fundamental to tho corporation is not fundamental to any stockholder.4
			Whether an amendment materially changes the corporate plans or not is a question of law for the court. Accordingly each case is to be decided according to the peculiar circumstances of that case, and no general rules can be laid down which will apply to all cases. Many illustrations are given in the notes below.6 &#x0027; Marlborough Ifg. Co. v. Smith, 2 Conn. 570 (1818); Brown v. Fairmount, etc. Co., 10 Phila. 82 (1873); Hope Ins. Co. v.

			§ 501. Amenllincts unlder t1w reservedl owoer of toe state to alter, amend, or relpel tle c7thrter.- The extent of the power of the leg- islaturo to amend a charter, whore it has reserved that power, is not yet fully settled, and is full of diloulties. Theor is a strong v. Knoxvillo, ot. R, , 22 Fop. Rep. 758 (1881); Kean v. Johnson, 0 N. J. Eq. 401 (1858); Black v. Delaware, etc. Canal Co., 24 N. J. Eq. 455 (1878). Cf. Lau- man v. Lebanon Valley R. R,, 80 Pa. St. 42 (1858), criticisod in Mowroy t: Indian- apolls, etc. L. R, 4 Bins 78 (1800); 8 c., 17 Fed. Cas. 90: Fry v. Lexington, otc. 1 R., 2 Mloto. (Ky.) 314 (18509 Until, however, the corporation accepts such nanendment tile stockholders cannot complain. Delaware, etc R. . t v. Irick, 23 N. J. L. 821 (1852). Amendments which have not been acted upon do not release the subscriber. Taylor v. Supervisors, 80 Va. 500 (1889). See, in general, Pearce v. Madison, etc. R. R., 21 How. 441 (1858); Tuttle v. Michigan Air Line R R., 85 Mich. 247(1877); New Jersey Mid. Ry. v. Strait, 85 N. J. L. 822 (1872). In all these cases neither a mandatory statute, nor a vote of the directors nor a majority of the stock- holders can compel a dissenting stock- holder to accept the change. It would be unconstitutional. The stockholder may say: "I have agreed to become in- terested in a railroad company, and have contracted in view of the profits to be expected, and the perils and losses incident to that description of business; but I have not agreed that those to be entrusted with the capital I contribute shall have power to use it in a business ofa different character, and attended with hazards of a different de- scription." Marietta, etc. R . v. Elliott, 10 Ohio St. 57 (1859). Even though tile legislature, after a turnpike corporation is organized, authorizes it to issue stock in payment for another turnpike, yet a dissenting stockholder may prevent tile purchase by showing that it decreases the value of his stock. Shaw v. Camp- bell, etc. Co., 15 S. W. Rep. 245 (Ky. 1891). Where the statutes under which the
			&#x0027; 10:
			company is organized allow the objects of the company to be changod on a vote of the stockholders, a dissenting stock- holder Is not released from his sub- scription by such change. Mercantilo Statement Co. v. Kneal, 51 Mlinn. 203 (1802). Acts relative to a corporation may be so radical as to constitute a new charter instead of amendments to the old one. Snook v. Georgia Imp. Co., 83 Ga. 01 (1880), Where a municipal- ity has subscribed for stock and issued its bonds indorsed by a railroad com- pany to raise money to pay the sub- scription, the legislature cannot author- ize the company to apply its assets to the payment of such bonds. A stock- holder may enjoin it. Hill v. Glasgow R. R., 41 Fed. Rep. 010 (1888). The leg- islature cannot, in the amendment it- self, authorize the majority to bind the minority herein. New Orleans, etc. R. . v. Harris, 27 Miss. 517 (1854) Where a charter authorizes a lease, if assented to by the stockholders, an amendment authorizing such a lease by the direct- ors would be unconstitutional, unless accepted by the stockholders. Re Opinion of the Judges, 28 S. E. Rep. 18 (N. C. 1897. Where a state is a stock- holder, and by statute is entitled to a certain vote at elections, a subsequent statute cannot give to the state a larger vote Tucker v. Russell, 82 Fed. Rep. 203 (1897). An amendment can- not deprive the members of a corpora- tion of the privilege of electing its di- rectors. The legislature cannot arbi- trarily name and appoint trustees of an educational corporation, the char- ter providing that vacancies shall be filled by the remaining trustees. Sher- iss v.

It should be restricted to those amendments only in which ttie state lhas a public interest. Any attempt to use this power of amendment for the purpose of authorizing a majority of tle stockholders to force upon the mi- nority a material change in the enterprise is contrary to law and the spirit of justice. Under such reserved power tile legislature has only that right to amend the charter which it would lave had in case the Dartmouth College case had decidedt that tle federal constitution did not apply to corporate charters.&#x0027; In fact the his- corporation.

For a valuable argument against the power of a majority of the stockholders to ac- cept an amendment of the charter so as to give the company the power to lease its railroad, see 8 Harvard L. Rev. 390. In Loewenthal v. Rubber, etc. Co., 82 N. J. Eq. 440 (1894), the court held that the original by-laws constituted a contract between the stockholders, and that a by-law providing for cumulative voting could not be repealed. On the right of a dissenting stockholder in gen. eral, see also Printing House r. Trus- tees, 104 U. . 711 (1881; Hoey v. Hen. derson, 32 La. Ann. 1009 (1880); Re St. Mlary&#x0027;s Church, 7 Serg. &#x0026; R. (Pa.) 517 (1822). A majority of the stockhold- ers of a railroad company have no power to amend the charter so as to ac- cept the general railroad act of the state, which general act will give the company the right to indefinitely ex- tend its railroad, build branch lines, lease its property, build and operate steamboats, or consolidate wvith any other railroad company. Such a whole- sale amendment is illegal as against the dissent of a stockholder, even though a
			portion of such general act might have been accepted as being not a funda- mental but merely an auxiliary amend- ment. Alexander t. Atlanta, etc. R. R. Co., 108 On. 151 (1899). Where an insurance fund has been collected by an exchange, in accordance with its charter, a by-law subsequently passed distributing the fund among the mem- bers is illegal as against the objection of any member who contributed tothe fund.

A holder of preferred stock may prevent a re- duction of the preferred dividend by an amendment of the certificate of in- corporation, even though the statutes of the state at the time of organization of the company authorized the certifi- cate of incorporation to be amended by a certain vote.

			torical origin of this reservation of the right to amend was due to the effort of the various states of the Union to escape from the de- cision in the Dartmouth College case.1 By this reserved right the restraint of the federal constitution is done away with. But the power to make a new contract for the stockholders is not thereby given to the legislature. The legislature may repeal the charter, but cannot force any stockholdor into a contract against his will.
			The power to make amendments, and to repeal and alter char- ters, has been reserved, in most of the states of the Union.2 It is clearly established that the legislature cannot, under this reserved power, amend the charter so as to change the whole character of the enterprise and compel the corporation to proceed under the amendled charter. The restrictions of the state constitution still exist, and individuals cannot bo forced by the state into new con- ent with constitutional principles. And N. Y. 407 (1803); Ashuelot R P. v.

			[§ 01o. tracts.&#x0027; Moreover the amendmcnt must not be foreign to the pur- poses and objects of tho original charter. The power of amend- ment has its limits. " It can repeal or suspend the charter; it can alter or modify it; it can take away the charter; but it cannot im- pose a now one and oblige the stockholders to accept it. . The power to alter and modify does not give power to mako any substantial additions to the wvork." The best view taken of this reserved power of the state is that under it a fundamental amend- ment to the charter does not authorize a majority of the stock- holders to accept the amendment and proceed, but that unanimous consent of the stockholders is necessary.&#x0027; County, 81 Ky. 593 (1884), an amend- ment under the reserved power, chang- ing the method of voting, was decided to be of no effect until the stockholders accepted it. The court said: "The right to amend the charter may be ex- pressly reserved, but that right does not confer the power of taking from the corporators the control of the cor- porate property." Seealso . 09a, infra, as to amendments affecting the right to vote. Query, whether a mandatory consolidation would be legal. Mowrey v. Indianapolis, etc. R R, 4 Biss. 78 (1806); s. c., 17 Fed.

But when the man- datory amendment goes beyond the legal limits, it must be accepted by the corporation as though it were made op- tional with the corporation. Kenosha, etc. I R. t. Marsh, 17 Wis 13 (1803), the court saying that the power of amend- ment was never reserved with refer- ence to any question between the cor- poration and its stock subscribers, but solely with reference to questions be- tween the corporation and the state, where the latter desired to make com. pulsory amendments against the will of the former. The corporation cannot be compelled to proceed.&#x0027; All the state "can do is to grant it the power, and then it is for the corporation to accept it or not, as it pleases."

I Under the reserved right to amend, alter, or repeal charters, the rights of stockholders among themselves cannot be impaired, except as required by pub- lio interest. While it is true that the charter constitutes a contract between the stockholders, yet under this reserved power the legislature may authorize existing corporations to purchase and retire preferred stock and issue in lieu thereof mortgage bonds, such ninend- nient being construed to be in behalf of the public interest. Berger v. United States Steel Corp., 53 Atl. Rep. 08 (N. J. 1902). Under the reserved right to amend charters, the legislature may authorize a corporation to reduce its capital stock and issue bonds in ex- change for such part of the capital stock as is retired, especially where the original charter authorized the corpo- ration to decrease its capital stock by purchasing its own stock. Venner Co. v. United States, etc. Corp, 116 Fed. Rep. 1012 (1902).

It is a contract thalt is protected in tile salme way as contracts of Individuals. Ilamilton, etc. Co. v. Hamilton City, 140 U. S. 258 (1802). As to tho latter point, Beo contra, City Ry. v. Citizens&#x0027; Street It R., 100 U. . 557 (1807). Wlloro an amendment exempts the coin- pany from taxation and provides that It shall furnish the city with water free of cost, a repeal of til ex- emption repeals tle obligation as to water. Louisville Water Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S. 1 (1820). An exemption from taxation may be repealed under the reserved right to amend, etc. Pearsall v. Great Northern Ry., 101 U. 8. 010, 003 (1800); Wagner Free Institute v. Philadelphia, 132 Pa. St. 612 (1800). As to such repeals see § 572b, infra. Under the reserved power to amend or repeal a charter the legislature may compel the corporation to pay wages weekly to its employees. State v. Brown, etc. Mfg. Co., 18 R L 10 (1802). Under the reserved right to amend the charter the legislature may amend so as to confine the road to a particular route, and outstanding contracts of the com- pany do not prevent such an amend- ment. Macon, etc. R. R. V. Gibson, 85 Ga. 1 (1890). Under its reserved power to amend, the legislature may require several railroads to acquire, build to, and use a union depot. Worcester v. Norwich, etc. R R., 109 Mass. 103(1871). Even though a provision in a special railroad charter provides that rates shall be fixed by its board of directors, yet, under a reserved right to amend, the legislature may authorize a state commission to regulate rates. Mat- thews v. Board of Corporation Com&#x0027;rs, etc., 97 Fed. Rep. 400 (1899). The legis- lature canot reduce the rates on a rail-
			road wlhoro tho original chartor fixed tio rates, and even a reserved right to ninond the chartor upon compensation being nmade does not sustain such re- duction of rates, no compensation being provided for. lingreev. Michigan, etc. Co., 118 Mich. 814 (1898). A stato, under its reserved power to amend or repeal chartors, cannot change the original statute as to rates to be charged by Ir- rigation companies, which prescribed that the actual investment should be taken into consideration by enacting a now statute which omits tlat cllock on the reduction. Ban Joaquin, etc. Co. v. Stanislaus County, 113 Fed. Rep. 930 (1002). In regard to the question of the constitutionality of a radical amendment to a charter under tie re- served right to amend, see Shields v. Ohio, 05 U.S. 810 (1877); Sinking Fund Cases, 99 U.

Dissenlint, stoclitlodr&#x0027;s relcd!l against an ill7gal amoenl- ment.--Wheore an unauthorized and illegal amendment has been accepted by a corporation and is about to be acted upon, a stock. holder has two remedies. If he has not paid his subscription, he may consider himself released from his liability to pay the sub- scription, or lie may begin suit in equity to obtain an injunction against or to set aside any action by the corporation under the amendment.4 If the stockholder has already paid his subscription, amend does not apply to subsequent amendments to an old charter where it was not so intended. A new charter may be so drawn as to be free from such a general antecedent statute. New Jersey t. Yard, 95 U. S. 104 (1877), rev&#x0027;g 37 N. J. L 228. Where, subse- quently to the incorporation of a com- pany, a general act reserves to the leg- islature the right to amend or repeal any and all charters, the legislature may repeal any amendments to the charter, so far as such amendments are passed after the general act, where the amendments do not expressly waive the legislative right of amendment or repeal. But any amendment should be "saving, whenever that power was exerted, all rights previously vested." An exemption from taxation may be repealed under the reserved power. (Approving Tomlinson v. Jessup, 15 Wall. 454-1872, and Railroad Co. v. Maine, 9G U. S. 490-1877.) Creditors stand upon the same footing in this re- spect. Louisville Water Co. v. Clark, 143 U.

Definition aln legality of a "trust" - Decisions in the various slates o, this subiject-The anti-trust act of Congress.-The word "trust" was first used to mean an agreement, between many stockholders in many corporations, to place all their stock in the hands of trustees and to receive therefor trust certificates from the trustees. The stockholders thereby consolidated their interests and became trust-certificate holders. The trustees owned the stock, voted it, elected the officers of the various corporations, con- trolled the business, received all the dividends on the stock, and used all these dividends to pay dividends on the trust-certificates. The trustees were periodically elected by the trust-certificate hold- ers. The purpose of the "trust" was to control prices, prevent competition, and cheapen the cost of production. The Standard, Oil Trust, the American Cotton-Seed Oil Trust, and the Sugar Trust were examples of this method of combination. IThe committee of the House of Rep- resentatives at Washington, in their re- port, explained the nature of the Stand- ard Oil Trust and Sugar Trust very clearly. The committee reports "that there exist a certain number of cor- porations organized under the laws of the different states and subject to their control; that these corporations have is- sued their stock to various individuals,
			10&#x0027;
			and that these individual stockholders have surrendered their stock to the trustees named in the agreements creating these trusts, and accepted in lieu thereof certificates issued by the trustees named therein. The agree- ments provide that the various corpo- rations whose stock is surrendered to the trustees shall preserve their iden- tity and carry on their business" See

			meaning. It is used to designate any combination of producers for the purpose of cqntrolling prices, reducing cost of production, and suppressing competition. In this sense of the word all schemes whereby those who were competitors combine their interests are "trusts."
			During the past ten years trusts have come into great promi- nence. They have multiplied rapidly and have extended into many branches of business. They have been the object of great popular opposition, and their legality has been assailed, both in the courts and by prohibitory statutes.
			The courts have held with great uniformity that these combina- tions are illegal if their purpose is to restrict production, raise prices, or restrain trade. The law is clear that any combination of competing concerns for the purpose of controlling prices, or limit- ing production, or suppressing competition, is contrary to pub- lic policy and is void. This principle of law has been applied with great rigor to some of the trusts. The two leading cases on the subject are the Sugar Trust decision in New York &#x0027; and the Stand- ard Oil Trust decision in Ohio. Many cases showing the differ- ent circumstances under which this rule has been applied are given in the notes below, arranged in the alphabetical order of the vari- ous states.s 4 Ry. &#x0026; Corp.

The court said: "Any combination of competing corporations for the purpose of controlling prices, or limiting production, or suppressing competition, is contrary to public pol- icy and is void."

A person who buys a trust certificate, the certificate containing a stipulation binding the holder to all the terms of the trust agreement, thereby becomes a party to an illegal transaction, and such person has no standing in court to obtain an accounting and distribu- tion of the property or profits. The whole agreement and transaction boing illegal, the court will leave the parties where it finds them. The court pointed out that thero was no proof in this case that the defendant trustees were seek- ing to derive any personal advantage from the agreement, but, on the con- trary, were endeavoring to carry out the wishes of nearly all of the certifi- cate-holders.

Where an Illinois corporation sues in New York on a subscription to its stock, it is no defense to allege that the company was to create a monopoly, where the only proof was certain pros- pectuses, etc., issued before the com- pany was organized. The defense is not good unless the company "was formed for purposes illegal here, or was doing acts prohibited by the laws of this state to its own citizens and cor- porations." U. S. Vinegar Co. v.

Wlere nmnufacturers form an illegal association to which they pay a certain sum, which they are to forfeit if they disobey its regulations and are expelled, one of them cannot enjoin the association from expelling him.

Where a manufacturer of a peculiar kind of machinery under a patent agrees with a trustee for several corporations that he, the manufacturer, will sell his ma- chinery to them alone, and they agree to give him a percentage of their profits the agreement is legal and may be en- forced by him. Good v. Daland, 121 N. Y. 1 (1800). Even though a party has a legal contract with a corporation by which he has the right to purchase certain goods monthly for a certain time, yet, if afterwards the corporation has sold out to a trust, and the trust assumes the contract and the party acquiesces therein and sues the trust for violation of the contract. the suit will fail, the trust agreement having limited the manufacture within a thousand miles radius of its headquar- ters Falvey v.

The owner of a grain elevator may bring suit for damages against the owners of other elevators and a railroad company who have en- tered into a combination by which the railroad will not carry grain for any ownerof an elevator unless the latter pays a certain sum to the railroad com- pany, the intent being to control the

The statute of Now York pro- hibiting the Issue of stock at less than par and of bonds at less than their fair market value does not prohibit the issue of stook and bonds by a gas conm- pany in payment for the stock and bonds of a competing gas company, even though a high value is placed upon the franchise of such competing company as a part of the purchase price. Such a transaction is not illegal on the ground of creating a monopoly, nor is it ultra vires, provided the charter of the first company allowed it to pur- chase stock and bonds, as provided in the New York statutes. Rafferty v. Buffalo, etc. Co., 87 N. Y. App. Div. 018 (1899).

			In the Chicago Gas Company case the supreme court of Illinois various patonts form a corporation and convoy to it their patents and take back licenses under which the corpora tion regulates tle price, and they agreo not to use any now patents and not to manufacture any now kind of harrow, tho combination isillegal. Any ono of thl parties may by suit in equity be rolieved from Its terms. Strait v National Harrow to., 18 N. Y. Supp. 224 (1891). The harrowtrust was again declared illegal in National Harrow Co. v. Bomont, 21 N.Y. App. Div. 200 (1807), but this decision was reversed it 10!) N. Y. 505. It is established "that no contracts are void as being in general restraint of trade wheoro they operate simply to prevent a party from engag- ing or competing in the same business" Hence, an agreement of one steamship company to pay another company a certain sum for withdrawing its line of boats was upheld as against the dissent of a stockholder in the former com- pany. Leslie v. Lorillard, 110 N. Y. 519 (1888). A large number of the propri- etors of boats on the canals made a com- bination. The income from every boat. over and above a certain amount al- lowed to the boat for expenses for wear and tear, was turned into the "pool." At certain times the fund in the " pool" was to be divided among tie parties according to the number of their boats. In an action to enforce payment under the agreement the court held that the whole arrangement was illegal, void, and not enforceable. Stanton tv Allen, 5 Donio, 434 (1848). The proprietors of five lines of boats engaged in canal transportation agreed to combine and do business at certain rates for freight and passage. The net earnings were to be divided among themselves in a fixed proportion. One of the parties sued another to compel him to make payment. The court held that the combination was void under the stat-
			uteR of Now York, and said: "It is a familiar maxlll that competition Is tle lifo of trade. It follows that whatever destroys or oven relaxes competition in trade is injurious if not fatal to It." Hooker v. Vandewater, 4 Donlo, 34U (1847). A coal company bought coal from several corporations upon thoircontract not to sell to any other parties in that locality. The purpose was to enable the purchaser of tie coal to havo a nmonop- oly of the market. The party which purchased the coal did not pay for it. The coal company which had sold brought suit for the price, but tie court held that the suit must fail. The com- pany had taken part in an illegal con- tract and combination. In such cases the parties are outside of the pale and protection of the law. The courts will not ail either party. Arnot .t Pittston, etc. Co., 08 N. Y. .558 (1877). Many salt manufacturers in New York state com- bined to limit the production and con- trol the price of salt. They formed a corporation, and each of the parties leased to the corporation his manufac- tory of salt. Each of the parties was, however, to continue the manufacture of salt in his manufactory, but only to a limited extent, and was to sell the product to a corporation at a fixed price. The agreement was carried out. One of the parties could not collect from the corporation the price for the salt delivered to it. and accordingly lie brought suit. But the court decided that lie could not collect. He lost his salt. and also tihe price of it. The law declares such combinations illegal, and will not aid any of tie parties. Clancey r. Onondaga, etc. Co., 02 Barb. 3U5 (1802). The agreement of the vari- ous members of the " Wire Trust" not to sell at less than a certain price is void.

Each trustee is liable personally for past breaches of trust, but an injunltionl against future acts can only be where all the trustees are made parties. Wall v. Thomas, 41 Fed. Rep. 020(1810).

United Stntos v. Jellico, eta Ca, 40 Fed. Rep. 482 (1891). A suit for damages, based on the federal anti. trust law, failed in Bishop v. American Preservors&#x0027; Co., 51 Fed. Rop. 272 (1802). The statute applies to illegal trusts of stock to unite competing railroads. Clarke v. Central R. R, 50 Fed. Rep. 838 (1802). In this case, however, on the final hearing, the bill was dis- missed. See Clarke v. Richmond, eto. Co., 03 Fed. Rep. 328(1804). In United States v. Patterson, 55 Fed. Rep. 005 (1893), the federal statute was held to apply in certain particulars, and not to apply in others. The act of congress relative to monopolies does not author- ize an injunction except on the part of the government. Blindell v. Hagan, 54 Fed. Rep. 40 (1803). An indictment of a number of lumbermen, for raising the price of lumber fifty cents a thou- sand feet, will not lie under the federal statute. United States v. Nelson, 52 Fed. Rep. 04G (1892). Indictments un- der the federal law against monopolies were quashed in Re Corning, 51 Fed. Rep. 205 (1802); Re Terrell, 51 Fed. Rep. 213 (1802); Re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104 (1892); United States v. Patterson, 55 Fed. Rep. 605, and 59 Fed. Rep. 280 (1893). A suit by a stockholder, to set aside an illegal transfer of the corporate property, cannot at the same time ask for the treble damages given by the anti-trust act of congress of July 2, 1890. Such a suit is multifarious, in- asmuch as the treble damages would go to the plaintiff, while the damages generally would belong to the corpo- ration. Metcalf v. American, etc. Co., 108 Fed.

			The anti-trust act of congress o&#x0027; 1890 does not apply to purchas. ers of cattle on the market, who form an association by which each agrees not to recognize any yard trader or employ any person to buy. or sell cattle unless eh be a member of the association. Interstate commerce is not directly involved in such an association, and, moreover, the purpose of the agreement was clearly to regu- late and not to restrict trade.2

			A statute of a state, prohibiting a foreign corporation from doing business in the state, if such corporation is connected with a trust, is constitutional.&#x0027;
			The fact is, however, that the industrial movement of the age is irresistibly towards consolidation and combination, in connec- tion with the expansion and extension of trade at home and abroad. The law is designed to check any abuses in this tendency, and has been successful in so doing. The law, however, is not intended to interfere with the legitimate demands of trade, and if such inter- ference is attempted it will be demonstrated, just as it was demon- strated in England in regard to statutory prohibitions against the consolidation of railroads, that the laws of trade are stronger than the laws of men.5 competitors, by which the members charged more to outsiders than to mem- bers.

			[§ o03b. In E ngland the genuine " trust" las been used for legitimate in- vestment purposes. The trustees are authorized to invest the funds of the " trust" in the stocks and bonds of miscellaneous corpora- tions. Generally, however,, they are limited in the amount which they may invest in any one direction. That which is lost in one investment is expected to be made up by large profits in another. It is a mode of investment on a large scale, and is mndo on the principle of an average gain and loss.&#x0027; In England it has been heold that a worlkman who has been discharged by his employer at the instance of a delegate of a workmen&#x0027;s organization, because he, the wolrkman, had at a previous time (lone work other than that which was his regular trade, cannot hold the delegate liable in damages, even though the disclharge was caused by threats of the delegate to the employer that unless the discharge was made all the inen would quit work.2
			The American "Car Trust" is practically an agreement of sev- eral owners of cars to place them in the hands of an agent to sell on the instalment plan, the agent having the power to issue certifi- cates representing an interest in the instalments.&#x0027;
			§ 503b. Further itnquiry as to the legality of a "trtst."--There are other things to be considered in determining whether or not a "trust" is legal. Does it vest personal property or real estate in a trustee for a longer period than is allowed by law ? Is the forma- tion of a trust for the purpose of carrying on business authorized by law ? Is the shifting of the parties interested - that is, the cer- the consolidation of railroads This legislation proved to be utterly ineffect- ive, and in 1872 a parliamentary corn mittee made an elaborate and exhaust- ive report on the subject, and said, among other things, that consolidation " had&#x0027;not brought with it the evils that were tanticipated, but that, in any event, long and varied experience had fully demonstrated the fact that, while parliament might hinder and thwart it, it could not prevent it." 1 See Healey, Company Law and Prac- tice (2d ed.), p. 101. For the form of articles of agreement of this kind of a "trust,"and for a detailed statement of the various provisions that are made, varying according to the character of the enterprise and the purposes of the participants, see Sykes v. Beadon, L R. 11 Ch. D. 170 (1879); Smith v. Anderson, L. R. 15 Ch. D. 247 (1880,; Wigfield v.

			be considered in the order named.
			It is the policy of the law to limit the time during which a person may tie up his personal property or real estate. Generally this tinme is fixed as the life-time of the survivor of any two persons then living and designated by the person creating the trust. Each state, by its statutes, generally limits the time during which prop- erty may be tied up by a trust, and if a trust is formed for a period longer than that allowed by statute the trust itself is void.&#x0027; There is little doubt that merchandise, land, and shares of stock may be placed in trust. The law is clear that "every kind of valuable property, both real and personal, that can be assigned at law w:ay be the subject-matter of a trust." 2
			A different question arises, however, in determining whether a trust may be created to carry on business an(l trade, or to control a concern which carries on business.3
			At common law the placing of personal property in trust for the purpose of carrying on business in the name and&#x0027;under the man- agement of the trustee is legal and allowable.4 The statutes of the l Gerard, Titles to Real Estate (3d ed.), p. 228. Moreover, if the time is to be measured by the life of a person then living, a trust which is to exist for a fixed period, however short. without reference to the life of a person then living, is void. Gerard, Titles to Real Estate (3d ed.), pp. 224, 225. In New York the suspension can be for only two lives in being, and, in certain cases, twenty-one years thereafter. 1 R. S., 773, § 1; L 1800, oh. 547, § 32. These stat- utes apply to real and personal property. Gerard, Titles to Real Estate (3d ed.), p. 235; Hone v. Van Schaick, 7 Palge, 221 (1838). Compare ~§ 812, 822f, infra; Holmes v. Mead, 52 N. Y. 332, 344(1873). The statutory prohibition against the accumulation of the income of trust property, except in the case of infants, applies both to real estate and person- alty. Girard,TitlestoRealEstate (ded.), pp. 283, 235.
			1 Perry, Trusts, § 67. s Under the statutes of New York a trust of property consisting of real es- tate is void, unless the purpose of the trust is to sell the land for the benefit of creditors; or to sell, mortgage, or
			lease it for the benefit of annuitants or for satisfying a lien on the land; or to receive the rent and use it for the sup- port of a certain person; or to accumu- late the rent for a certain person. L, 1800, ch. 547, § 70. Accordingly a mod- ern " trust," whose property consists of real estate in New York, might be void. But as to personal property the law is generally different. As toNewYork, see Gerard, Titles, p. 235. Of. §§ 812, 82f. 4 For decisions at common law to the effect that property may be vested in trustees for the purpose of carrying on business, see Exparte Garland, 10 Ves. Jr. 110 (1804); Scott v. Izon, 84 Beav. 434 (1805). In Holmes v. Mead, 52 N.Y. 332, 344 (1878), the court said: "A trust in personal property, which is not in conflict with the statute regulating the accumulation of interest and protect- ing the suspension of absolute owner- ship in property of that character, is valid when the trustee is competent to take, and a trust is for a lawful purpose well defined, so as to be capable of being specifically executed by the court. . . .

			Tlere is little difilculty in determining the question whether it is allowable in law to create a truat where the Cosatti8 que tr&#x0027;ustt- that is, the oertifioate-holders-- change and fluctuate in their identity. Tile law (loes not require the cestusi quo trust to remain continuously one and the same person. He is not indefinite, even though by transfer of interest his identity may change.2
			A more formidable objection to the legality of a "trust" is that it is similar to an unincorporated joint-stock association, and that the latter is illegal; inasmuch as it assumes the powers, privileges, and name of a corporation. It was on this ground that the decision in Louisiana declared that the American Cotton Oil Trust was illegal, and was disqualified to (do business within that state. The court held that, under the statutes of Louisiana, an unincorporated joint-stolc association is illegal; that a &#x0027; trust" was one kind of an unincorporated joint-stock association, and consequently that it was illegal and void.&#x0027;
			But this view of the law would not be sustained elsewhere in this country; nor would it be sustained under the old common law of England. Unincorporated joint-stock companies have existed for years and are common throughout all the other states of the Union. They are legal methods of carrying on business.4 trusts, which applies only to trusts in real property." In Gott v. Cook, 7 Paige, 521, 534 (1839), the chancellor said: " The Revised Statutes have not attempted to define the objects for whicl express trusts of personal estate may be cre- ated, as they have done in relation to trustsof real estate. Suchtrusts, there- fore, may be created for any purposes which are not illegal." See also Graff v. Bonnett, 31 N. Y. 9(1865). In Power v. Cassidy, 79 N. Y. 002, 013 (1880), the court said: "The law does not limit or confine trusts as to personal property except in reference to the suspension of ownership, and they may be created for any purpose not forbidden by law." To the same effect, Bucklin v. Bucklin, I Keyes (N. Y.), 141,(1804); Goebel v. Wolf, 113 N. Y. 405 (1889).
			I Many of them, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, Da- kota, North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsyl- vania, Connecticut, Kentucky, and Ver-
			mont, have statutes expresslyspecifying the objects for which a trust may be created. See Stimson, American Stat- ute Law, § 1703. 2See Harrison v. Harrison, 36 N. Y. 543 (1807), affirming 42 Barb. 102; Holmes v. Mead, 52 N. Y. 332, 343 (1873); Conkling v. Washington University, 2 Mld. Ch. 497 (1849); 1 Perry, Trusts, § 6G. In regard to this matter, a "trust" is legal on the same principle that it is legal for a bondholder secured by a railway trust deed or mortgage to sell and transfer his interest to another. 3State of Louisiana v. American Cotton Oil Trust, 1 Ry. &#x0026; Corp. L. J. 509 (1887), the court saying: "A joint- stock company is not known to the laws of Louisiana." 4 See § 504, infra.

			clear that a trustee who carries on any kind of business is liable personally, and to the entire extont of his private fortune, for all the debts incurred in the management and execution of the trust. It is possible, however, that the uso of the words "as trustee," in tlhe contract entered into, will protect him against this liability.&#x0027; And there is little doubt that the creditors of the trust may collect their debts from its property. This has been a doubtful point, but is now reasonably well settled. It matters not whether the trus- tees have expressly bound the trust property to pay the debts. Where the trustee is insolvent, a creditor of the trust may proceed against its property to procure payment of a debt incurred in the execution of the trust.&#x0027;
			But a different rule prevails as regards the cestui qeo trust, the beneficiary. The cestui qlui truest cannot be held liable for the debts created by the trustees or for debts incurred in the execu- tion of the trust. This question has arisen chiefly in cases whore trustees have carried on the business of an insolvent person for the porated companies. At tat time they were regarded as "dangerous, mis- chievous,&#x0027; and, in short, public nui- sances." But the statute was repealed in 1820, and Lindley, the great English judge and jurist, says of it: "Juster views of political economy and of the limits within which legislative enact- ments should be confined have led to the repeal of the statute in question, which, though deemed highly benefi- cial half a century ago, probably gave rise to much more mischief than it prevented." Lindley, Company Law (5th ed.), p. 132. Moreover, a careful examination of the English authorities up to the present day shows conclu- sively that at common law an unincor- porated joint-stock association is legal and valid.

			It has been hold also that the trustee cannot rondor the cestui quo trust liable even though tho trustee contracts with thQ creditor to that effect.3
			There is little doubt that these old principles of law are appli- cable to "trusts." The courts of England have decided that a modern "trust" is not a partnership or mere association, but is similar to an old common-law trust estate. This conclusion was reached in construing an English statute which prohibits certain .partnerships or associations from doing business.&#x0027;

			Tlhe property of the " trust" cannot be seized for the individual debts of the trustee,&#x0027; but the interest of the certilfcato-liolder may be reached so as to subject it to the payment of his debts.5 In this respect the certificates resemble shares of stock.
			The trust property, where it consists of personal property in the nature of bonds, stocks, notes, or evidences of indebtedness, or corresponds to the capital stock of the corporation, may be taxed at the place where the main office or place of business of the "trust" exists. The extent of the taxation (lopends, of course, upon the statutes of the state wherein the tax is laid.6
			There is more difficulty in determining whether a certificate- holder may terminate his interest in the " trust" and demand his proportion of the property. In certain "trusts," whose property the broad distinction between trustees and directors." Smith v. Anderson, L R 15 Ch. D. 247 (1880) ISimonton v. Sibley, 122 U. S. 2°0 (1887). Where a railroad construction contract is assigned to trustees to be carried out and the profits to be paid to the stockholders of a designated corporation, the stockholders may com- pel the trustees to pay over such prof- its. The trustees cannot set up that they were also directors of the railroad. Hazard v. Dillon, 84 Fed. Rep. 485 (1888). 2l ills v. Hurd, 29 Fed. Rep. 410 (1887). 3 2 Perry, Trusts, § 917. 4 Gibson v. Stevens, 7 N. H. 352 (1884), where a trustee was authorized to con- tinue the testator&#x0027;s business. The prop- erty was held not subject to the trus- tee&#x0027;s personal debts.
			6 As to the rule at common law, see 2 Alb. L J. 261, 288. In New York, by statute, all transfers of personal prop- erty made in trust, for use of the per- son making the same, are void as against his creditors, existing or subse- quent. 2 R. S. 135, § 1 (7th ed., p. 2327, and cases there cited). See also Graff v. Bonnett, 31 N. Y. 9, 14,18 (1865). 6 Ricker v. American Loan, etc. Co., 140 Mass. 346 (1885). See also People v. Albany Assessors, 40 N. Y. 154 (1869); Re Jefferson, 35 Minn. 215 (1886), citing many cases on this subject. In New York state, under its statutes, shares of stock in either domestic or foreign corporations, which are subject to tax- ation on their capital stock, are not subject to taxation except shares of stock in banks, See § 565, infra. 1068 X 003 r/.]

			single cortillcate-holder cannot have the whole "trust" dissolved and wound up before the timo fixed by the trust agireemeont for its dissolution las arrived.&#x0027;
			If the "trust" itself is forbidden by tile statutes of tho state wlheroin it exists, it will not be wound up by the courts. Tle law will not compel a trustee to account for property or transactions which grow out of a contract which is prolibitod by statute. The courts leave the partics where they are found. They are outside of the protection of tlh law.3
			If, however, tlhe "trust" is legal, it may be terminated at any time by a decree of a court, upon the consent of all tile parties who are interested in it.4 But a "trust" will not be dissolved and wound up merely because the trustees have been guiltyof a breach of trust. The remedy in such a case is to enjoin or remove tle trustees.&#x0027; Where, however, the trust is insolvent and incapable of proceeding, a dissolution anl winding up of its business will be de- creed by a court."
			B. UNINdORPOBATED JOINT-STOCK ASSOCIATIONS. § 504. Dcfinitiolns-Joint-stock complaniies, clubs, exc7ihanles, etc.-Owtnership of land.- A joint-stock company may be defined to be an association of persons for the purpose of business, having 1 See § 603b, supra, and § 022, infra. A syndicate operation was involved in Hogg v. Hoag, 107 Fed. Rep. 807 (1901), where certain stocks and property were transferred to a trustee, who issued certificates therefor to the mem- bers of the syndicate. A part of the subscribers did not pay, and the vendor of the property took the trustee certifi- cates of such non-paying subscribers, and on the death of the trustee a bill was filed to have the court substitute a new trustee, and one of the subscribers filed a cross-bill for an accounting. The court decreed a winding up of the syndicate and appointed a receiver. The court held that a partial payment made to the vendor of the stocks was legal, even though all the property was not conveyed to the trustee, as contem- plated, and that the vendor&#x0027;s accept- ance of the certificates of non-paying subscribers obligated him to pay there- for, although such trustee&#x0027;s certificates
			had become worthless, the transaction being in connection with the Oregon Pacific Railroad Company. The court said that the syndicate was in sub. stance, though not technically, a joint- stock company. 2 Smith v. Anderson, L. B. 15 Ch. D. 247 (1880). The same rule prevails in unincorporated joint-stock associations. See Smith v. Virgin, 83 Me. 148 (1851). See also Waterbury v. Merchants&#x0027; Union Exp. Co., 50 Barb. 157 (1867), holding that such company will not be wound up merely because the directors have been guilty of a breach of trust. 3Re Padstow, etc. Assoc., L R 20 Ch.

			A joint-stock company lies midway between a corporation they were to exist had not yet expired. See also Sieglhortnor v. Wesoisonborn, 30 N. J. Eq. 172 (1809); Howell v. IIarvoy, 5 Ark. 270 (1843); Van Ness v. Fisher, 5 Lans. 230 (1871); Brien v. Harriman, 1 Tenn. Oh. 407 (1873); Holladay v. Elliott, 8 Oreg. 81 (1870): Bagley v. Smith, 10 N. Y. 480(1853j. In Sibley v. Minton, 27 L J. (Ch.) 53 (1858), the court hold that, in an action by an adventurer in a cost- book mining company to wind up the company and adjust the losses, all the co-adventurers were necessary parties. 1"A joint-stock company is an asso- ciation of individuals possessing a com. mon capital divided into shares, of which each member possesses one or more. These shares represent the inter- est of the members, and are transfer- able by the owners without the consent of the other members or the creditors of the association." Kossakowski v. People, 177 111. 563 (1890). In Hedge&#x0027;s Appeal, 03 Pa. St. 273 (1869, following the statute 8 &#x0026; 9 Vict, c. 110), it is de- fined to be "a partnership whereof the capital is divided, or agreed to he divided, into shares, and so as to be transferable without the express con- sent of all the copartners" In the stat- utes of Massachusetts the words " joint- stock company" are used to mean a corporation organized under the gen- eral incorporation act of the state. At- torney-General v. Mercantile Ins. Co., 121 Mass. 524 (1877). But this is not an accurate use of the term. "The articles of association of an unincorpo. rated joint-stock company bear the same relation to it that the charter bears to an incorporated company; they regulate the duties of the officers and the duties and obligations of the mem-
			bers of such a company among thom- solves; tley specify tho capital, limit the duration, and define the business of the company." Bray v. Farwell, 81 N. Y. 000 (1880), per Earl, J. See also White v. Brownell, 4 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 162, 193 (1808). In Robbins t. Butler, 24 III. 887, 420 (1800), it is said that joint.stock companies "have none of the rights and immunities of . . a regularly incorporated company. These stock companies are nothing more than partnerships; and every member of the company is liable for the debts of the concern, no matter what the private arrangements among them- selves may be." To the same effect, see Moore v. Brink, 4 Hun, 402 (1875); Skinner v. Dayton, 19 Johns. 518 (1822); Wells v. Gates, 18 Barb. 554 (1854); Keasley v. Codd, 2 Calr &#x0026; P. 408 (1820). "The term &#x0027;joint-stock company&#x0027; appears to have originated in England in comparatively recent times. Joint- stock companies may be said to be partnerships, or individuals associated for some specified purpose, under a designated name or description, to which, by some general or special stat- ute, when they have been formed or composed in a specified manner, some of the powers or proper attributes of a corporation have been given." Dayton, etc. R. . v. Hatch, 1 Disney (Ohio), 84, 90 (1855). Factors&#x0027;, etc. Ins. Co. v. New Harbor, etc. Co., 37 La. Ann. 238, 239 (1885), speaks of a joint-stock company as "a nondescript organization, com- posed of the owners of certificates show- ing the proportion of their respective interests in its assets and liability for its obligations, and who are co-owners or proprietors in common.

It differs from a copartnership in that it is not dis- solved by a transfer of stock; and each member has not the same powers of transacting business and disposing of the assets as in a partnership.

Statutory joint-stol(7l comulp!l-- Conduclt of m1eetings.- Tlhero is an ossontial differenco between a joint-stock compainy as it exists at coimon law and a joint-stock compnny having oxtensivo statutory powers conferred upon it by tho state within which it is organized. The latter kind of joint-stock companies are found in Englannd and in the state of New York. To such an extent have tlese statutory powers been conferred on joint-stock companies that the only substantial diff&#x0027;ernce between them and corporations is that the mncinbers aro not exempt from liability as partners for the debts of the company. Accordingly, joint-stock companics, both those of England and New York, have been held to be corpo- rations in many respects, although expressly declared by statute not to have that character.&#x0027; A joint.stock association under the I In the case ofOstrom v. Greene, 101 N. Y. 853 (1000), the court said that a voluntary unincorporated association of seven or more persons, without capi- tal stock, is, under the statutes of Now York, neither a joint-stock company, nor a corporation, nor a partnership, but that its proceedings would be tested by the law of corporations and partner- ships so far as applicable. See Thomas v. Dakin, 22 Wend. 0 (1880): Warner v, Beers, 23 Wend. 103 (1840); Parmily v, Tenth Ward Bank, 8 Edw. 895 (1840); People v. Watertown, 1 Hill, 010 (1841); Bank of Watertown v.

Cas. 963: Duncan r. Jones, 32 Hun, 12 (1884). A joint-stock association existing in New York and
			suable by the laws of New York by service on its president may be sued as a corporation in Ohio, although not actually incorporated in New York. Adams Express Co. v. State, 55 Ohio St. 00 (1800). The United States Express Company, an unincorporated associa- tion under the laws of the state of New York, is treated as a corporation in other states. Edgeworth v. Wood, 08 N. J. L 403 (1800). The taxation stat- utes of Pennsylvania imposing taxes upon corporations organized in another state do not apply to an unincorporated association, an express conmpany organ- ized in New York. Sanford v. Gregg, 58 Fed. Rep. 00 (1893). The English joint- stock company is much the same. "The company has a name as an association, maintaining the identity of the body through all changes of its members; its property is divided into transferable shares; and it has conferred upon it the legal capacity to sue and be sued in the name of one of its officers, and such a suit . . . may be brought by or against a member as well as a third person." It is a corporation, though the English statute declares it is not. Oliver v. Liverpool, etc. Ins. Co., 100 Mass. 531 (1808): asf&#x0027;d sub non. Liver- pool Ins. Co. v.

A minority of an unincorporated voluntary as- sociation may adjourn from time to time, even if a majority of all the members is necessary to constitute a quorum in order lawfully to transact business.&#x0027; A voluntary unincorporated association, with- outarticles, constitution, or rules, may remove its president or other oillcer at any time and without notice, except that the meeting held for that purpose must be duly hold, but cannot expel a munl- ber without notice.4 An unincorporated association may purchase its own stock, and a question of whether a reduction of the capital stock is thereby effected is a question of intention.&#x0027; An unincor- porated express company cannot be compelled to divulge to railroad commissioners the business it does outside of the state, the purpose of the investigation not being connected with taxation.6 A limited Sanford t Supervisors of Now York, 15 How. Pr. 172 (1858); Waterbury v. Mer- chants&#x0027; Union Exp. Co., 50 Barb. 157 (1807). As regards the liability of the members for the debts of the company, it is held to be acopartnership. Boston, etc. R. R. . Pearson, 128 ass. 445 (1880); Oliver v. Liverpool, etc. Ins. Co., 100 Mass. 531 (1808): asf&#x0027;d sub nom. Liver- pool Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 10 Wall. 506 (1870). The refusal of the legisla- ture to call them corporations is impor- tant as cutting off the exemption of the members from liability to creditors; an exemption which, at common law, be- longs to all corporations. Joint-stock companies in England have always been largely statutory. See Van San- dau &#x0027;. Moore, 1 Russ. 441 (1820). In New York the English decisions on these companies are doubtless good au- thority, since they exist under statutes which are much alike. In New York the statutes relative to taxation of cor- porations do not apply to joint-stock companies. They are not corporations. People v. Coleman, 133 N. Y. 279 (1892); Hoey v. Coleman, 40 Fed. Rep. 221 (1891). An unincorporated joint-stock associa- tion is legal in New York. Under the
			statutes of that state such associations are corporations for many purposes. People v. Wemple, 117 N. Y. 130 (1880). 1 ICossakowski v. People, 177 111. 503 (1800). "Ostrom v. Greene, 101 N.

In this case the court stated that it was open to question as to whether a majority of all the members in an unincorporated association was necessary in order to constitute a quo- rum. 4 Ostrom v. Greene, 161 N. Y. 853 (1900), the court saying: "The holding of an office unprotected by rules is not an individual right, but is subject to change at the pleasure of the associ- ation." a Booth v.

			§ 500. Joint-stookl compl;anits may ariso byI imnplication) of law. Joint-stock companies are generally formled by the mutual agree- ment and direct intent of the parties. They may, however, arise by implication of law. Thus, an ineffectual attempt at an incorpo- ration may make the parties members, not of a corporation, but of a joint-stock company.4 In like manner, after tho charter of a cor- poration expires and the parties continue to do business, they do so as a joint-stock company.&#x0027; 1 Great, eta Co. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 440 (1000), overruling Andrews Bros. Co. v. Youngstown Coke Co., 80 Fed. Rep. 585. A New York joint-stock association cannot sue as such in the federal courts. Chapman v. Barney, 120 U. S. 077 (1880). A partnership association under the statutes of Pennsylvania is not a cor- poration to the extent that the estate of a stockholder is liable on a claim arising after the death of such stock- holder. Bodey v. Cooper, 82 Md. 025 (1800). Nor is it a corporation within the meaning of the tax statutes. Gregg t. Sanford, 65 Fed. Rep. 151 (1895). An association formed under the Pennsyl- vania statutes is a partnership and not acorporation. Henceitcannot besued in Massachusetts in the name under which it does business. Edwards v. Warren, etc. Works, &#x0027;d8 Mass. 564 .(1897). In Carterv. Producers&#x0027; Oil Co., 182 Pa. St. 551 (1897), the court said in regard to Pennsylvania joint-stock as- sociations organized under the statutes: "Whether the partnership association ought to be classified by the professor of legal science as a species of the genus corporation, or the genus partnership, or whether it should be set apart as a new genus, seems to me unimportant. If a corporation, it is so peculiar in its features that the general law of corpo-
			10
			rations cannot be applied to it without important modifications; if a partner- ship, it so differs from the common type that the general law of partner- ships is but slightly applicable. Both the law of corporations and the law of partnerships are to be resorted to in the absence of statutory regulations, the choice being determined by the nature of the feature under considera- tion. . : . Apartnershipassociation differs from the common type of part- nerships in that the members vote, and do not act with the powers of part- ners, and in that they are subject to no joint liability. It differs from the common type of &#x0027;corporations in that the members have a right to admit or refuse membership in the company to the transferee of the interest, as well as in some other particulars." 2 Rouse, etc. Co. t.

Hlow a porson becolmes a mlme,, r - Transfers.- A person becomes a mombor of a joint.stock company by any act which in- dicates an intent to become a mombor on his part, and a consent or acquiescence therein by tile company itself.&#x0027; Ilo may also be- come a momber by a transfer made to him of another member&#x0027;s interest, unless the articles of association restrict the right of transfer.2
			§ 508. Liability of members to creditors and to the colmpany.- A joint-stock company is, in regard to the liability of its members to creditors of the company, a partnership; its members are liable as partners;&#x0027; and the ordinary rules of partnership exist between the iThe formalities need be no greater than in forming an ordinary partner- ship. Slhuylervillo Nat. Bank r. Van Derwerker, 74 N. Y. 234 (1878); Pettis v. Atkins, 00 III. 454 (1871): Machinists&#x0027; Nat. Bank v. Dean, 124 Mlass. 81 (1878). Cf. Volger v. Ray, 131 Mass. 489 (1881) It is not necessary that certificates of the stock be issued in order to consti- tute membership. Dennis v. Kennedy, 10 Barb. 517 (1854); Boston, etc. R. R. v. Pearson, 128 Mass. 445 (1880). Evidence of subscription and payment of an as- sessment is sufficient. Frost v. Walker, 00 Me. 408 (1872). But not of subscrip- tion without any participation. Iledge&#x0027;s Appeal, 03 Pa. St. 273 (1809). 2 A transfer of the certificate of stock has such effect although not registered inthestock book. Butterfield v.Beard- sley, 28 Mlich. 412 (1874). Transfer may be before the certificates are issued. Butterfield v. Spencer, 1 Bosw. 1 (1850). But if the articles of association pro- hibit transfer, the transferee takes only the right to profits, not as a part- ner, but as an assignee, and a transfer does not carry dividends already de- clared. Harper v. Raymond, 3 Bosw. 29 (1858). So, also, where transfer is allowed only on consent of certain officers who refuse, Kingman v. Spurr, 24 Mass. 235 (1828). If atrans. ser is improperly allowed, the com- pany is liable to the party injured. Cohen v. Gwynn, 4 Md. Ch. 357 (1848). Although an unincorporated associa- tion&#x0027;s articles provide that transfers of
			stook shall be made only with consent of the directors, yet, where such pro- vision is for many years disregarded, a stookholdor who so transferred his stock at a time wlen tie assets equaled the liabilities cannot be held liable as a stockholder. Wadsworth v. Duncan, 104 111. 800 (1800); Wadsworth v. Lawrie, 104 III. 42 (1800). See also § 022, infra. Where an unincorporated partnership issues so-called certificates of stock representing a specified interest in such partnership, and one of the partners as- signs his certificates as collateral secu- rity and afterwards sells them, the pur- chaser is entitled to his share of the partnership property and to demand an accounting, even though the certifi- cates provided that they were not trans- ferable. The transfer of such certifi- cates as security need not be recorded as a chattel mortgage. Rommerdahl t. Jackson, 102 Wis. 444 (1899). As to the liability of the transferee, see next section. See 78 N. Y. App. Div. 007. A member&#x0027;s interest cannot be reached by execution. Kramer r. Ar- thurs, 7 Pa. St. 105 (1847). But see Lindley, Partn. (2d Am. ed.), p. 837. The holdersofcertificatesin an unincor- porated irrigating ditch association are tenants in common, and any one may sell his interest without the consent of the other.

			of an unincorporated Lloyds insurance association may be liable personally on its policies, even though by the terms of the policy each underwriter assumed only his proportionate part of the loss, where that provision is not prominently set forth. The rule is that the members of an association may contract against personal lia- bility, but the notice to that effect must be so plain and fair that the person contracting with the association knew of it, or it was his own fault that he did not know it.l But where the articles of association of an unincorporated joint.stock association provide that the members shall not be personally liable for the debts, a person who loans money to the association on its note, which ex- pressly states that it is given under such articles, cannot hold the members personally liable.&#x0027; The member&#x0027;s subscription may be enforced by a suit at law.4

It has been held that lh need not allege or prove any special reason or purpose of his desiro and request to examine the books;4 but the vast size of modern corporations, with hundreds or thousands of stockholders and many tary may forcibly take them from hil.m IHeoinway v. Henminway, 58 Conn. 448 (1890). 1 A bill of discovery lies at instance of corporate creditors in the courts of one state to comnpol corporate officers to give the names of stockholders of the corporation In another state with a view to enforcing the statutory liabil. ity in the latter state. Post t. Toledo, etc. R. R., 144 Mass. 841 (1887). As to the remedy by subpoena, etc.. see § 519, infra. 2 See § 872, infra; Re Kent, etc. Syn- dicate, [1898] 1 Q. B. 754. A receiver of an insolvent bank must allow the dis. trict attorney to examine the books and papers to ascertain the condition of tle bank and whether the officers had criminally received deposits after the bank became insolvent. McElree v. Darlington, 187 Pa. St. 593 (1898). 3 Lewis v. Brainerd, 58 Vt. 510 (1881). A stockholder has the legal right to inspect the books of she corporation of which lie is a member, but the com- pany is not liable for a refusal of tile secretary to allow a stockholder to ex- amine the books. Legendre v. New Orleans Brewing Assoc., 45 La. Ann. GG9 (1893). Where the president has cus- tody of the books and refuses to allow a stockholder to examine them, and the stockholder desires to examine them for the purpose of ascertaining whether he should sell his stock, and is
			obliged to obtain a malndamnus, ie may hold the president liable in an action for damages, and if tie price of the stock has fallen during the delay in obtaining access to the books his mens- ure of damages is his loss, especially where the president was in the menn- time selling bis own stock. Bourdette v. Sieward, 52 La. Ann. 1333 (1100). In a suit by a stockholder against an offi- cer for damages for refusal to allow him to examine the books, remote, col- lateral and speculative damages cannot be recovered. Even though he alleges that he would have sold his stock if he had been allowed to examine tle books. and that the stock subsequently declined in price, yet if there was no mismanagement and the decline of tile stock is due to causes which an in- spection of the books would not dis- close, he cannot recover the loss due to the decline in the stock. Bourdette v. Seward, 31 S. Rep. 630 (La. 1002). A minority stockholder is not entitled to a receiver in a suit brought by him for an acconnting and winding up the company, even though he is refused an inspection of the books of the com- pany, and especially so where lie was denied the right for several years for the reason that le did not pay his sub- scription, and he finally sold his stock.

			clerks, renders it impossible to open all the books to all the stock- holders, and ronders necessary the rule that some good reason be given by the stockholder applying to examine the books.
			§ 513. Mllandamus is the l)refera(bl recldly.-An action for dam. nges is generally totally inadequate as a remedy.&#x0027; The stockholder wishes to inspect the corporate books and does not wish damages or a lawsuit. Accordingly, in certain cases, upon the application of a stockholder who has been denied the privilege of examining the corporate records, it has been the practice of the courts to issue a mandamus to the corporate officers commanding them to allow a specified stockholder to examine the books of the corporation." The remedy of a stockholder who wishes to examine the corporate books in order to bring suit against the directors for fraud is by 77andatnus, not by an order for inspection.&#x0027; The usual statute giving to the courts the power to order a corporation to allow its stockholders to examine its books does not take away the common- law right of stockholders to have such an inspection, and does not take away the power of the court to grant a manadanmu to enforce such common-law right.4 A stockholder&#x0027;s bill against a corpora- tion and directors may be to remedy certain alleged frauds, and also incidentally to obtain a disclosure and discovery. The stock- holder need not resort to a manadampus.5 1 In Cookburn v. Union Bank, 13 La. Ann. 289 (1858), the court said a suit for damages "might last for a long time and petitioner suffer great loss by being debarred from an examination" of the books. "He does not ask for damages, but for the exercise of a right. If he has the right he ought to have the exercise of it as soon as possi. ble; for the deprivation of his right cannot, perhaps, be accurately esti- mated in damages. It may be many years before the amount of the dam. age can be known." 2 " It would seem, from the weight of authority and in reason, tlat a share- holder is entitled to mandamurs to comn- pel the custos of corporate documents to allow hiin an inspection, and copies of them, at reasonable times, for a spe- cific and proper purpose, upon showing a refusal on the part of the cstos to allow it, and not otherwise." Common- wealth v. Phoenix Iron Co., 105 Pa. St. 111 (1884); s. c sub nlom Phoenix Iron
			Co. v. Commonwealth, 118 Pa. St. 503 (1880), explaining the method of pro- cedure, and holding that the applicant need not institute a suit in a court of equity. The old rule that mandamus will issue only for a public purpose is no longer a rule of law so as to prevent its use herein. Commonwealth, etc., su.pra, questioning Rex tv Bank of Eng- land, 2 B. &#x0026; Aid. 020 (1819); and Rex v. London Assur. Co., 5 B. &#x0026; Aid. 899 (1822). See also Rex r.

Bay State Gas Co., 91 Fed. Rep. 940 (1898). Where the suit is brought by the stockholder against the corporation alone to remedy the frauds of directors and have a receiver ap- pointed and obtain a disclosure, the bill is defective for non-joinder of the guilty )96

It is an extraordinary remedy, to bo invoked only upon spcoial occasions.

The reasons for granting the writ "should be clear and cogent. ... To hold that every person who shows himself to be a stockholder of stock is at lib- erty to demand an examination of the transfer books when and an often as he pleases, and, if refused, to apply for a writ of mandamut8 to enforce an abso- lute right, would be to establish a rule highly prejudicial to the interests of all corporations and their stockholders. . . . The power of the court should be exercised in such cases with great discrimination and care." People v. Lake Shore, etc . R.. 11 Hun, 1 (1877); affirmed sub nom. Re Sage, 70 N. Y. 220 (1877). See also People v. Northern Pac. R. R., 50 N. Y. Super. Ct. 450 (1884). "Di3sretion in these matters should be exercised in a reasonable manner and subject to precedent." Regina v.

Where the right of in- spection is statutory, manldamus will issue, even though a stockholder de- sires to examine the books for the bene- fit of a competing concern in which hel is interested. Johnson v. Langdon, 07 Pac. Rep. 1050 (Cal. 1902). A statute giving the right to examine the books and records gives the right to examine contracts, and this right may be en- forced by maidanm, s.

Mandamus lies to enforce a statutory right of inspection. Unrea- sonable delay after a request is suffi- cient to sustain the niandanms. The mandamus may run to the president and general manager who has control of the business. The fact that the stockholder is interested in a rival com- pany and is unfriendly towards the of- ficers is immaterial Cobb v. Lagarde, 120 Ala. 488 (1001). A mandamus to compel the production of the books of the corporation should run to the cor. poration itself and not to the manager. State v. North American, etc. Co., 105 La. 879 (1001) Mandamus may be di- 1102 § 10o.]

Mandamus lies at tie in- stance of a stockholder to examine the corporate books to enable the stock- holder to learn the true condition of the company and of its management and of the value of the stock. There is no presumption that (lie inspection is hostile to the interest of the com- pauy, and it need not be alleged that a demand was made during business hours at the colmpany&#x0027;s office, or that the person making the demand repre- sented the stockholder, where it is shown that the officers refused to grant inspection under any circum. stances.

In a stockhollor&#x0027;s application at common law for a mand(lmus to compel tho corporation to allow him to inspect the cash book and other books, tle papers must chlow for what purpose the insp.ction is desired. EIven though a corporation does not allow inspection of its stock book, as required by statute, yet if, after a mandamus has been applied foi&#x0027;, the corporation offers to pay the costs and open tho stock book for inspection, tho applicant is bound to dis- continue &#x0027;le proceedings.4

			§ 518. Statutes giving righ7t of inslpeolionl.-Tho right to inspect corporate records is frequently given to stockholders by statutory provisions. In Now York the statute gives to all stockholders the right to exr.!ino the corporate stock book,&#x0027; and this statute has been applied to foreign corporations having an ofleoo and a stock book within the state.2 Sometimes the statute provides for the inspection of all corporate records.3 .Mandamus lies to enforce given by the charter: and consequently, and of necessity, ho must remaiin ig. norant of their aotion until theychoose to make that action known " (dictum). Alabama, etc. It. . v. Rowley, 0 Fla. 508, 514 (1801). See also Lindley, Com- panies, under "Inspection" in Index. In Streit r. Citizens&#x0027; F. Ins. Co.. 29 N. J.

No lion at common law.- Corporations, both in this country and in England, frequently possess and exercise a lien on a stockholder&#x0027;s stock for debts due from that stockholder to the corporation. In this chapter it is proposed to consider thd origin of the lien; the extent to which it may, be exercised and enforced; the waiver of it by the corporation; and its effect generally upon the transfer of shares.
			It is clear that at common law a corporation has no lien upon the shares of its stockholders for debts due from them to the com- pany.1 The policy of the common law has always been to discoun- tenance secret liens, inasmuch as they hamper trade and restrict the safe and speedy transfer of property.2 It is upon this ground that iGemmell v.

A by-law creating a lion in behalf of the corporation on stook is valid as against a stockholder and any one who pur- chases his stook with notice that such by-law exists. John, etc. Co. v. Wood- side, 87 Md. 140 (18981 In the case of Costello v. Portsmouth, etc. Co. 09 N. IL 405 (1809), the court upheld a by-law of a brewing company which gave the corporation a lion on the stock of its stockholders for any debts due from them to the corporation, and also gave the corporation a right to appropriate such stock at its par value in liquida. tion of such debts when overdue three months. The corporation actually did so appropriate the stock of one of its stockholders in that manner and after- wards sold the stock to a third party, and the court upheld the transaction. Under the English statutes a by-law may provide that the company shall have a lien on the stockholders&#x0027; stock for debts due from them to the com- pany. Allen v.

In the cane last cited it was held that not even where the certificate of stock con- tained a provision that the stock was not transferable until all the llabilities of tle stockholder to the bank were paid did the bank acquire a lien upon the slhares for the subsequent indebted. ness of tle stockholder. And all tle New.York decisions proceed upon tle broad ground that the policy of the law is to protect a bona Jide vendee of shares of stock against secret or equitable claims thereto. Cf. Loggett v.

A by-law preventing tle transfer or vot- ing upon stock while dues remain un- paid is invalid, even though the stock- holder agreed to be bound by such by-laws. Kinnan v.

Washington Bank, 23 Mass. 324 (1828), the court doubted whether a by-law could under any cir- cumstances create a lien on stock as against the creditors of the stocklolder, but did not decide the point. In Sar- gent v. Franklin Ins. Co., 25 Mass. 90 (1829). there is a somewhat decided ground taken against the validity of any by-law which tends to limit the free transfer of stocks. In Plymouth Bank v. Bank of Norfolk, 27 Mass. 454 (1830), Chief Justice Shaw seems to doubt the validity of a by-law giving a bank a lien on its own stock. 1116

			lion on the stock.&#x0027; Inasinuoh as by tile laws of England an Eng. lish corporation may amend its by-laws so us to give it a lion on stook which will bo prior to any existing unregistured pledge or assignment of the certificates of stock, an Anmorican pledgeo or holder of such certificates of stock is bound by such by-law.2
			Upon tlho whole it may be said that tlh question whether a cor- porttion may, by by-law, create a lion in its own favor upon tlh shares of its stockholleors for debts duo by theom to the corporation is not settled. The weight of authority in this country is against the validity of the by law, and such woull seeoi to be a result most in accord with public policy.
			In New Iampshire such lions upon stock are forbidden by statuto. Tile right to create a lien by contract is considered elsewhere.4
			§ 523. Notice of 1te lien.--When a lien is expressly given to the corporation by its charter or by statute, all persons purchasing the stock are affected by tile statute and must take notice of it."

			§§ 524, 525. It is a salutary rule that a lion created by by-law can bind only those who take the stock with notice of the by-law. This is because by-laws do not of themselves impart or convey notice.&#x0027; A transferee of a certificate of stock is not bound to take notice of a by-law giving a corporation a lion on the stock for debts due from the registered owner to the corporation, oven though the certificate of stock stated on its face that it was subject to the by- laws.&#x0027; So, too, a by-law enacted subsequently to a transfer, al- though the transfer has not boon recorded on the corporate hooks, cannot affect the rights of the parties as to that transfer.&#x0027; Where, however, a prospectus, oflering for sale trustee&#x0027;s transferable cer- tificates, states thatsuch certilicates represent stock deposited with the trustee, the stock being in an English corporation, the trustee is personally liable if it turns out that the English corporation had a prior lien on the stock to the full extent of its value. The trustee was bound to take notice of the lion created by the by-laws of the English corporation.4 By-laws creating liens on stock have been held valid and enforceable as against assignees in bankruptcy or in insolvency.6 A lien created by by-law is binding upon a pur- chaser of the stock with notice of such by-law, and when taken in pledge for an antecedent debt without any agreement to postpone collection, the pledgee is bound to take notice of the by-law.6
			A clause in a charter declaring that debts due from the stock- holders must be paid before a transfer will be allowed is sufficient statute giving the corporation a lion upon the stock. Curtice v. Crawford, etc. Bank, 110 Fed. Rep. 830 (1901). l Driscoll v. West Bradley, etc. Co., 59 N. Y. 90, 109 (1874); Bank of Holly Springs v. Pinson, 58 Miss. 421,435 (1880); Anglo-Californian Bank v.

Y. 630, concerning the validity .and effect of by-laws regulating the sale and transfer of seats or membership in the commercial exchanges, and the en- forcement of the liens created there- upon by such by-laws in favor of other members of the corporation. Where the by-law under which the lien is claimed directs that notice of the lien should be given in the certificate of stock, this provision must be regarded as meaning that the lien should not be asserted against a person not having notice by the certificate. And the issu-
			11:
			ance of certificates not containing this notice is a waiver of the lien contem- plated by such by-law. Bank of Holly Springs v. Pinson, 58 Miss. 421 (1880). 2 Des Moines, etc. Bank v. Warren, etc. Bank, 97 Iowa, 204 (1896). 3 People v. Crockett, 9 Cal. 112 (1858). 4 The rule of caveat emptor has been relaxed so as to create an implied war- ranty of title on the part of the seller. Even though the trustee acted as agent, yet, the principal not being disclosed, the trustee is liable. McClure v. Central Trust Co., 165 N. Y. 108 (1900). aMorgan v.

			to create a lien on the stock without other notion on the part of the corporation.&#x0027; So, also, a power conferred by the charter upon the directors to refuse a transfer so long as the stockholder who wishes to transfer ie indebted to the corporation, supports the lion.&#x0027;
			A lion nay be created by special agreement among the stock- holdors.&#x0027; And even a more usage of a corporation not to transfer stock while the owner is indebted to the corporation is sullioiont to create a lien on stock, as between the corporation and its stook- holders, and it will bind a stockholder who borrows money with a lnowlodgo of it.&#x0027; An unwarranted claim of lien by a corporation, and consequent refusal to register a transfer until the debt as to which the lion is asserted is paid, is a conversion of the stock, and the transforrer may have his action against the corporation therefor."
			In Ohio it is hold that where the certificates of stock issued by a bank contain a provision on their face that the bank shall have a lien on the stock for all debts duo to it from the registered owner, such lien is valid and applies as well to a debt contracted after the ceertilicate was sold but before it was presented for transfer on the I Farmers&#x0027; Bank Case. 2 Bland, Ch.

The stockholders may assent to a lien in behalf of the corporation on stock for debts due to the corporiaton from the stockholder, and the method of foreclosing it may also be so prescribed. The statute of lim- itations does not run against it. Read- ing Trust Co. v. Reading Iron Works, 137 Pa. St. 282 (1800). The corporation cannot create a lien on stock by a by- law; but where the surety of the debt secured by the stock as collateral pays the debt, his equities are not superior to the corporation, and he cannot claim the certificate free from the lien, he having aided in passing the by-law. Bank of Atchison County v. Durfee, 118 Mo. 431 (1893). 4 Morgan v. Bank of North America, 8 Serg. &#x0026; R. (Pa.) 73, 88 (1822); s. c.. 11 Am. Dec. 575. Of. Vansands v.

It is sulllcient that such cortificato of stock was tile one used by tho corporation.l And the saeo rule has been upheld in Pennsylvania2 and in California, Connecticut and else- where.&#x0027; A national bnnk, however, cannot claim a lien on stock for a stolkholder&#x0027;s debt, oven tilougll notice of such lion is printed on tile face of thoe certilicates of stock.4
			§ 520. T&#x0027;le lie., wle,. establish ed, coters al l the stookholder&#x0027;s sha(res and dlivillnd.-- A valid lion in favor of the corporation, when regularly established, attaches to all tle stock and dividends of the indebted stockholder. Thus, it attaches to all the stock the stock- holder owns, although the debt be for calls duo anl unpaid upon only a part of thom.5 It may, moreover, hold the whole lamount of the stockholder&#x0027;s stock, although tho amount of tile debt be loss than the value of the stock. It cannot be compelled to transfer so muoli l Stafford v. Produce, otc. Co., 61 Ohio St. 100 (1899). 2Where the certificate of stock itself provides that the stock is liable to the company for indebtedness of the reg- istered stockholder to the company, this constitutes a contract which will be upheld and enforced by the courts, and dividends on the stock may be ap- plied towards such indebtedness. In re Hovey&#x0027;s Estate, 198 Pa. St. 385 (1001). tBy inserting in the certificate of stook a statement that the corporation has a lien on it for debts due to the corporation, a purchaser takes subject thereto. It is a contract lien. Jen- nings v. Bank of California, 79 Cal. 323 (1889). In Vansands v. Middlesex County Bank, 20 Conn. 144 (1857) it is field that a statement on the face of the certifi- cate of stock that it is issued subject to all debts due from the owners to the corporation will bind a transferee as a qualification or restriction of the trans- ferrer&#x0027;s title, and that, too. although no charter provision or by-law authorizes such a lien on the stock So, also, Jen- nings v. Bank of California, 70 Cal. 323 (1889). A by-law of a corporation, or- ganized to own and maintain a hunt- ing park, may authorize assessments on the stock to pay any annual deticiency,

The by-law is valid as a con- tract, even though it is not valid as a by-law. Blue Mountain, etc. Assoo. v. Borrowe, 51 Atl. Rep. 070 (N. H. 1001).

			rate books in the name of a fictitious person is subject to a lien for the indebtedness of the real owner.&#x0027; The corporation, in transfer- ring stock to the trustee in bankruptcy of a stockholder, has no right to write on the faco of the cortilicate that it is sujoct to a lion belonging to the corporation, even though such lien exists, all other certilicates of stock not having any such writing on thorn. An executor is entitled to have stock belonging to the estate trans. ferred into his own name as executor, and the corporation is liable in damngos for refusal to make such transfer, even though the cor- poration has a lien on the stock for a debt owed it by the dooecd- ent.J
			§ 529. The lien can be enforcedlbr the benlfit of the corporation only.--Tho right of a corporation to a lion on the stock of its stockholders as security for the payment of their debts to the cor- poration is a right to be enforced only by the corporation and ex- clusively for its own benefit. Accordingly, it is held that the corporation cannot become the assignee of the claim of some third person against one of its stockholders in order to enforce payment of that claim for the benelit of the third person by a recourse to the corporate lien on the stockholder&#x0027;s stock.* Neither can the corporation be compelled, for the benefit of sureties as to a part of the stockholder&#x0027;s indebtedness, to apply the proceeds of the sale of the stock to the liquidation of that part of their claim whicll is secured.&#x0027; The lien does not extend to claims against the stock- holder on paper made by the stockholder and purchased by the iStebbins v. Phoenix F. Ins. Co., 3 Paige, 350 (1832), where the president of a corporation with fraudulent intent procured shares to be recorded in a sic- titious name, and, having himself be- come indebted to the corporation, pro. cured an assignment of the shares to another creditor, who sought to have the transfer recorded. IHeld, that the lien still attached for the debts of the original holder. 2 Re W. Key, etc., 80 L T. Rep. 374 (1902). 3 Under the statutes of California this rule applies to an alien corporation doing business in that state. the stat- utes of the state requiring such corpo. rations to make transfers in that state. It applies even though the statutes of Great Britain forbid transfers of stock "without administration upon such property under the laws of England
			and Great Britain." London, etc. Bank v. Aronstein, 117 Fed. Rep. 601 (1002). 4 A bank having a lien by statute for any debt held by it against a stock- holder cannot purchase notes of the stockholder for the express purpose of acquiring such lien, the bank at the time of the purchase knowing that the stock had been pledged by the stock- holder to another creditor.

			§ 530. Mc7thods &#x0027;t f eofbrcing the liel.- When a corporation has a lien upon tho stoclk of thoso of its stockholders who are indebted to it, it may rofuse to allow a transfer of tho stock until theo debt is paid or secured to its satisfaction.3 And the corporation may insist upon its lien and hold tho stock even against a bolnajido purchaser, inasmuch as purchasers of stool are bound to tako notice of legal liens.4
			The corporation may proceed by an attachment of the stockl.5 So also, upon non-payment of tile (ebt, the corporation may iilo a bill in a court of chancery and have the stock sold in the usual way, as in other cases of property hold under a lion." In Mich- igan, however, it is held that a suit in equity will not lie to enforce such universal application that it woull require strong evidence of legislative intention to make the present case an exception to it."

			has a lien on the stool of any stock- holder for a debt due from hiinm to the corporation, the lien is a good defense to an action in another state against the corporation by a person to whom the stockholder has transferred his stock, but in whose name, by reason of the lien, the corporation has refused to register the transfer.

			a statutory lion which it corporation has on stock of its stockhold- ers for debts duo from them to it.&#x0027; It was on very much tho sallo theory as this that the XNw England and Pennsylvania courts originally hold that a chancery court had no inhorent jurisdiction to foreclose a mortgage lion- decisions which for half a century embarrassed those states until the legislature created the jurisdic. tion which ought nover to have been denied.2 In a suit to fore- close a lion the transferrer of the stock is not a necessary party.&#x0027; A lion may be enforced, even though the debt is barred by the statute of limitations.4 A decree authorizing the sale of stock for the payment of the debt need not give the stockholder the right of redemption. An absolute and valid title may pass to the purchasor immediately upon the sale.&#x0027; A valid lion in favor of a bank upon shares of stock in the bank belonging to the estate of a deceased person does not yield to a prior claim against the estate in favor of the grovernment.&#x0027; Where the stockholder has died, and his es- tate is being distributed, the portion going to the corporation, by reason of its lien, will not be decreased by the amount of such divi- dends.? In order to put the corporation in the wrong for a refusal to transfer whore it claims more than is due, the stockholder must tender what he admits to be due." The fact that a stockholder claims that the corporation owes him more money than he owes it one of its debtors was sustained in MIc- ilroy, etc. Co. v. Dickson, 60 Ark. 327 &#x003C;1890).

Inonecase the lien was held to be equivalent to a pledge: and it was hell that, after giving due no- tice to the delinquent stockholder, the corporation might sell at public auction withoat filing a bill to foreclose. Farm- .ers&#x0027; Bank&#x0027;s Case, 2 Bland, Ch. (MId.) 394 (1830). In this case it is also held that, where the corporation neglects or re- fuses to sell the stock of a deceased stockholderwhol is in arrears. the admin- istrator may file a bill and obtain an order of sale directed to the corporation.

A judgment creditor&#x0027;s execution lien on bank stock is subject to the lien of the corporation itself by statute on the stock for debts due to it from the judgment debtor, and a further statutory provision that the enforcement of the corporation&#x0027;s lien shall not affect attachment or execu- tion liens goes merely to the remedy and does not affect the priority.

Some other ground of equitable juris(liction must be sot forth. Whlore a corporation has other security also, a court of equity nay coinpol it to resort to that first.3 A corporation is liable in dam- ages for selling the stool; of a stockholder for non-pay ment of duos, where such salo was irregular and illegal.u Where by statute bank stock may bo sold for non-payment of assessments levied upon it to restore the capital stock, the money for which it is sold belongs to the stockholder and not to the bank.4
			§ 53 1. The corporation may lwaive its lion.- A corporation which has a lion upon its stockholders&#x0027; stock for debts due to it from them need not necessarily depend upon or insist upon its lien for the collection of tho debt. It may collect the debt as though there was no lien. HIence it is that the lien of a corporation on stock the claims of other creditors of the stookholder out of his general assets. Cf. Re Peebles. 2 Hughes, 804 (1875); . c., 10 Fed. Cas. 04, and §§ 473,470, supra. l Elliott v. Sibley, 101 Ala. 844 (1803). This case holds, also, that in a suit in equity by a stockholder to enjoin a sale of his stock by the corporation for a debt due the corporation, the corpora- tion is a necessary party defendant, and that the complainant must aver a readiness to pay whatever may be found due. 2Covington, etc Bank v. Commercial Bank, 65 Fed. Rep. 547 (1895). Where the company has a lien on stock, and the stockholder sells a part, the pur- chaser may require the company to first have recourse to the unsold part to collect its debt. A subsequent execu tion levied on the unsold part does not deprive the purchaser of the other part of his rights stated above. Gray v. Stone, 60 L. T. Rep. 282 (1893). 3The sale here was contrary to the requirements of the by-laws. The cor- poration bought the stock itself at such sale. The fact that a surplus realized at the sale was sent to the stockholder by check, and was received by him, did not bar his remedy, he being in igno- rance of the illegality. Allen v. Ameri-
			can Building, etc. Assoo., 40 MIin. 514 (1802).
			Chicago T. &#x0026; T. Co. v. State Bank, 80 Fed. Rep. 803 (1808). In Tennessee it has been held that where stock is only partly paid, and the corporation issues a certificate reciting on its face how much is still due, and the holder pledges it, and no transfer to the pledgee is made on the corporate books, the corporation can have a sale of the stock for non-payment of the balance remaining due, but such proportion of the proceeds will be paid to the pledgee as the amount already paid on the stock bears to the par value of the stock. Ingles, etc. Co. v. Knoxville, etc. Co., 53 S. W. Rep. 1111 (Tenn. 1800). 5 A subscriber for stock cannot avoid liability to the corporation by setting up that the corporation has a lien on the stock therefor and may enforce it. Lankershim, etc. Co. v. Herberger, 82 Cal. 000 (1800). Even though by the statutes under which an English corpo- ration is organized the company has a lien on the stock for unpaid assessments and may forfeit the stock for non-pay- ment, yet this does not prevent a suit to collect the assessment. Nashua, etc. Bank v. Anglo-American, etc. Co., 103 Fed. Rep. 704 (1001). See also § 124, 1128 § 531.]

			may bo asserted and enforced, or, in the discretion of tile corpora- tion, it may be waLivedl.
			Where the corporlation lhas other security it is not obliged to resort to tile lion.2 Cases may arise, however, whore tile intervon- ing rights of other creditors of tile stockholder ren(ter it inequitable for tile corporation to waive its lion on the stook."
			Accordingly, whlre a note discounted for a stockholder was pro- tested for non-paymlent, it was h1eld that the bank might proceed directly against the indorsor without resorting to its lien.&#x0027; Tho cororration, by waiving its lion, does not discharge a surety, unless the surety has given the corporation express notice not to waive the lien.&#x0027; But where a corporation has a lion on stock and at the same time owes a stockholder a certain debt which is guaranteed by a tlird person, and the stockholder causes the corporation to waive the lien without the consent of the guarantor, the guarantor is thereby discharged.&#x0027; The corporation will not be hold to have waived its lien upon the stock of its debtor merely because it has taken other or additional security for the debts;7 nor because it as- sents to a general assignment by the stockholdor for the benefit of creditors.8 But of course if a corporation, having a statutory lien on stock, agrees to take other security in place thereof, it thereby waives its lien.&#x0027; The corporation may allow the transfer of a portion of a stockholder&#x0027;s stock without waiving its lien on the rest.1" The fact that the corporation transfers other stock be- longing to the same stockholder is no waiver of its lien on stock as against a pledgee of some of the stock, the debt being greater supfa. Where the statute provides that stock shall be taxed, and that the corporation shall pay the tax and have a lien therefor on the stock, the stock- holder is not personally liable to the co-poration which has paid such tax. Mercantile, etc. Co. v. Mellon, 196 Pa. St. 176 (1900). 1 National Bank v. Watsontown Bank, 105 U. S. 217 (1881); Hodges v. Planters&#x0027; Bank, 7 Gill &#x0026; J. (Md.) 306 (1835); Hall v. U. S.

			than the value of all the stockl. A waivor of the lion for a limited time is fatal, provided the stock is transferred during that timeo.
			A waiver which will bind the corporation may, in the absence of something to qualify the power, be made by the cashier of a bank, acting by virtue of an express or implied authority, for the board of directors;&#x0027;1 or the secretary of an insurance company;4 or the general manager or properly-qualilled general agent of the corpo- ration, especially if that is a general custom of the company." Accordingly, where one buys stock on the faith of a representation of the corporato ollicers that the stock is unincumbered, he is entitled to the stock free from any corporate lion.0
			Where the corporate olliceors allow a transfer to be registered, and a now certilicate to be issued, there is a waiver of the corpo- rate lien as to the debts of the transferrer.7 Where the corpora- tion sells a claim it has against a stockholder it thereby loses its lien.8 The lien is not waived by a by-law that stockholders must offer their stock to the bank before selling elsewhere, and that after But cf. Presbyterian Cong. v. Carlisle Bank, 5 Pa. St. 345 (1847). I Commonwealth v. Standard, etc. Co., 50 Atl. Rep. 1003 (Pa. 1902). 2Thus, if within such time the stock is pledged for a debt, the right of the corporation, after the expiration of the time to acquire its charter lien. is sub- ordinate to the right of the pledgee un- til the debt is paid or the pledge is re- leased. Bank of America v. McNeil, 10 Bush (Ky.), 54 (1873). 3 National Bank v. Watsontown Bank, 105 U.S. 217(1881). So, also, the refusal of the cashier to permit a transfer is the act of the bank, for which it may be charged. Case v. Bank, 100 U. S. 446 (1879). Where the cashier of a bank takes part in the pledging of stock by one of the stockholders, the bank can- not subsequently claim a lien on the stock for debts incurred by the stock- holderaftersuch pledge. Birmingham Trust, etc. Co. v. Louisiana Nat. Bank, 99 Ala. 379 (1893). 4Chambersburg Ina Co. v. Smith, 11 Pa. St. 120 (1849). Cf. Kenton Ins. Co. v. Bowman, 84 Ky. 430 (1886). 5See Bishop v. Globe Co., 135 Mass. 132 (1883); Young v. Vough, 23 N. J. Eq. 325 (1873).

R. 10 Eq. 458 (1870). After transfer on the books the transferrer is no longer liable for the subscription price, and the trans- seree is liable even though the cor- poration has a lien on the stock by statute, the transfer having been al- lowed by the officers of the corporation. Rochester, etc. Co. v. Raymond, 158 N. Y. 570 (1899). So, also, a by-law re- quiring the consent of the board of directors to a transfer by one indebted to the corporation is held to be repealed where a custom of disregarding it has been shown, it appearing also that the secretary had been allowed to exercise his own discretion about such transfers without consulting the directors. In such a case the consent of the secretary to the transfer is a waiver of the lien. Chambersburg Ins. Co. v. Smith, 11 Pa. St. 120 (1849); 94 N. W. Rep. 200. 8Ralston v.

			ton days thoy may soil elsewhere.1 Where a party about to talo stock in pledge inquires of the corporation as to its value, and as to whethor there was any lion upon the stock, and no lion is claimed, and he then takes tlio stock in pledge, and causes an indorsement thereof to be made on the stub of tile stock book of the corporatiol, the corporation cannot thereafter claim a lien as against him; and morcover, a subsequent transfer of the stock by the pledger to tho corporation as security for a debt duo from him to it does not tako precedence over the first pledge, the certificates themselves having been transferred to the first pledgee, but not transferred on the books.2 The fact that the debt of the corporation has existed sov- eral years and has not been enforced does not affect the company&#x0027;s statutory lien upon stock of its creditor."
			§ 532. l&#x0027;l liien ats ajl&#x0027;ctlel by tran.sfe rs and notice.- A.purchaser of stock is bound to take notice of the statute giving a lien upon the stock.4 Nevertheless, upon a transfer of stock, the title thereto passes absolutely as between transferrer and transferee, even though the corporation, in the assertion of a lien upon the stock for the in- debtedness of the transferee, refuses to register the transfer until a certain debt is paid or secured.6 But of course the assignee or transferee, or whoever succeeds to the rights of the stockholder in the stock, takes it subject to the lien of the corporation.u And when

			The corporation cannot, after it has been regularly notified of tho transfer, assort a lion upon tho stock to securo an indebtednoss of tile transferrer contracted subsequently to tile notice.2 A moro notice to tile bank is, in such a case, sulilcient to protect tile trans- force. It is immaterial that the transfer was not registered.&#x0027; Whero the directors of a corporation know tlat a stockholder of record has transferred his stock, the corporation cannot claim a lien for debts incurred subsequently.&#x0027; But where there is neither a register of the transfer nor notice of it served upon the corporation, tile stock nmay properly be subjected to a corporate lien for the indebt- edness of the transferror incurred subsequently to the transfer. A 1Tuttle u Walton, 1 Ca. 43 (1810); Foster v. Potter, 37 Mo. 525 (1800); West Branch Bank v. Armstrong, 40 Pa. St. 278 (1801); Weston v. Bear River, etc. Co., 5 Cal. 180 (1855). 2Conant v.

Briggs, L R. 12 App. Cas. 20 (1880). But where the stockholder transfers his stock, and subsequently, without notifying the corporation of the trans- ser, borrows money from the corpora- tion in regular course of business, the corporation may refuse to register the transfer and may insist upon the lien. Platt v. Birmingham Axle Co., 41 Conn. 255 (1874). Where it is the custom to have the corporation, upon request, certify that it has no lien, such a re- quest operates as notice to the corpo- ration. Covington, etc Bank v. Com- mercial Bank, 65 Fed. Rep. 547 (1895. This case holds also that notice to the corporation by a loaner of money to the stockholder does not inure to the benefit of a purchaser who knew noth- ing thereof. 94 N. W. Rep. 200. 3 Bank of America v. McNeil, 10 Bush (Ky.). 54 (1873) See also §g 259, 382,383, 400, 523. supra. A debt incurred after notice to the corporation of a transfer
			of stock by the stockholder is not pro- tected by the lien, but knowledge nac quired by the president in another capacity is not suchl a notice. People&#x0027;s Bank v. Exchange Bank, 43 S. E.

A lien of abank on stock for a debt due from a stockholder to the bank is subject to a pledge of the stock where such pledge was made before the delt was incurred, and the bank Incurred the debt with knowl- edge of the pledge. Knowledge of the facts by the president is notice to the bank. Curtice rt Crawford, etc. Bank, 118 Fed. Rep. 390 (1902). S Platt v. Birmingham Axle Co., 41 Conn. 255 (1874): Jennings v.

			VWhere one pays a debt as surety for a stockholder, he is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the corporation by way of lien on the stockholder&#x0027;s stock.3 And where the transfrooe pays the trans- ferrer&#x0027;s debt to the corporation in order to obtain a registry of the transfer, he of course may lavo his action to recover back from his transferrer the amount so paid.&#x0027;
			Where the comlpany has a lien upon the stock of a stockholder, the latter may compel the company to assign their lion to a third person who will advance the money, and to whomn the shares are at the same time transferred.3
			g 533. Liens on national-bank stock.-aNtional banks were for- morly held to have power to enact by-laws creating a lion on stock in the bank for debts owed by its owner to the bank.? But the supreme court of the United States, when the question came beforo it, refused to enforce such a by-law, and decided that its enactment was not within the spirit of those provisions of the National Bank- L. I. 21 Ch. D. 302 (1882). In England, however, unrecorded transferees of stock have few, if any, rights as against the corporation. It is held in Ohio that where the certificates of stock issued by a bank contain a provision on their face that the bank shall have a lien on the stock for all debts due to it from the registered owner, such lien is valid and applies as well to a debt contracted after the certificate was sold but before it was presented for transfer on the books of the bank. The lien exists even though neither the statutes nor the by-laws nor the resolutions of the board of directors provided for such lien. It is sufficient that such certificate of stock was the one used by the corporation. Stafford t. Produce, etc. Co., 1 Ohio St. 160 (1899). See also g 522, supra. Until the cor- poration has notice of a sale or a pledge of the certificate of stock it may con- tinue to loan money to the stookholder and have a lien therefor.

			A corporation may, in general, mako four different kinds of divi- donds: namely, a dividend payable in cash, in stock, in bonds or scrip, or in property.
			Dividends are declared by the directors and not by tile stock- holders.&#x0027; A division of prolits without the fornimlity of doclaring n dividend is equivalent to a dividend.&#x0027;&#x0027; A division of theo rolits is a dividend oven though not called such and not considered such ly the directors and stockholders.3 It is legal for a corporation to distribute its prollts by the payment of salaries, provided all the stockholders assent thereto.4 A stockholder cannot prove by parol rectors and consent of all its stock- holdors may agree that a certain per. centago of its proilts shall be paid an- nually to a person for services already rendered by himn. In a suit by himin to enforce such agreement, and asking an injunction against any sales of stock, except with notice of such agreement, stockholders are necessary parties de- fendant. Such an agreement is not an exclusion of future boards of directors from the management of the company. Dupignao v. Bornstrom, 70 N. Y. App. Div. 105 (1002). Cf. g 078, infra. 1 See § 545, infra. 2 Rorke v. Thomas, 56 N. Y. 559 (1874); Reading Trust Co. v. Reading Iron- works, 137 Pa. St. 282 (1890); Mclusick v. Seymour, etc. Co., 48 Minn. 172 (1892). See also § 572a, infra. Where a fixed per cent. is paid annually to stockliold. era instead of dividends and chargcd to them, and the stock held in pledge for the same, such a payment to the life tenant does not create a valid lien on the stock as against the remainder. man. Reading Trust Co. v. Reading Ironworks, 137 Pa. St. 282 (1890). The stockholders may agree among them- selves informally to distributea certain sum as dividends without going through the form of corporate action. No formal declaration is necessary, either by the stockholders or board of direct- ors, and a distribution of profits by a unanimous consent without corporate action is legal Groh&#x0027;s Sons v. Groh,80 N. Y. App. Div. 85 (1003) 3Commonwealth vu Pittsburg, etc.
			Ry., 74 Pa. St. 83, 00 (1873), holdlng that a stock dividend was not such a divi. dend as entered Into a rate of taxation. Lehiglh Crane Iron Co. v. Common- wealth, 55 Pa. St. 448 (1807), where the capital stock was $100,000, but divi- dends wore declared on an asslumed capital of $1.000,000, the property being worth the latter figure by reason of profits invested in it. The same device was resorted to in Citizens&#x0027;, etc. Ry. v. Philadelphia, 40 Pa. St. 251 (1805). "Dividends declared," as used in an employee&#x0027;s contract of payment for services, tle rate of payment being ac. cording to such "dividend," were con- strued to mean profits, even though not distributed by dividends, the intent being clear. Acceptance of part pay- ment is no bar to an action to collect. Scase v. Gillette-Ierzog Ifg. Co., 55 Hinn. 349 (1893). Where large salaries are paid, instead of declaring dividends, the object being" concealment and de- lusion," the court will not hold that such "salaries" are a part of the man- ufacturing expense of a defendant guilty of infringing a patent. Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 788 (1869); Seabury v. Am Ende, 152 U. S. 501 (1894).

			Numerous eases on the definition of the word "dividend " havo arisen in connection with the taxation of corporations.2 Corpora. tions have inherent power to declare and pay dividends, even though they have no capital stock.3
			§ 535. Scril dtiridends, p)roperty dividenols, and bolnd dividends. A scrip dividend is a dividend of certificates giving tie holder cer- tain rights which are specified in the certilicate itself. These divi- dends are usually declared when the company has profits which are not in the shape of money, but are in other forms of property, and the company wishes to anticipate the time when the property may be sold for cash, and the cash distributed by a money divi- dend. The certificate sometimes entitles the holder to a sum of money payable with interest at a certain time after date, or at the option of the company, or when the company shall have accumu- lated sultlcient surplus to pay the certificates in full. Sometimes the certificates are certificates of indebtedness, and are made con- vertible, at the option of the holder, into bonds or stock;4 and dends, the corporation distributes it profit by large salaries, there Is dange that upon the death of one of thor others may continue the payment c such salaries to themselves, eve thougl they are executors of the di ceased officer&#x0027;s estate.

The colnpany had the right to piay ofl the sorip and retire it. The comn pany sold part of the land, and theln proceeded to nmake a scrip divi- dend of the scrip so taken up by it. A dissenting Hcripholder brought suit to undo tile trantaction on the ground that tie scrip taken up by the com- pany should be canceled. The court sustained his action, and held that from tie origiinal contract it was clear that tihe land was received as a trust fund to ultimately pay off the scrip. Reversing Rogers v. Phelps, 0 N. Y. Supp. 880 (1800). In Brown v. Lehigh, etc. Co., 49 Pa. St. 270 (1803), a dividend of scrip had been declared, the scrip being as follows: " No. -. scaIP. Shares. "This is to certify that - -, -- heirs or assigns, will be entitled, upon the surrender of tils certificate, to - shares in the capital stock of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Com- pany so soon as the present funded debt of the company has been paid off,or adequate provision made for its discharge when due and paynent demanded; and will also be entitled to a pro rata slaro of any future distribution of scrip; but not to any cash dividend until this cortifl- cate Ias been converted into stock, as above provided. "Or this certificate may at any time, at the option of the holder thereof, be converted into stock upon payment by said holder, either in cash or in the six per cent. loans of the com- pany, of the par value of said stock, and the suirrender of this certificate.

The court held, however, that the terms of tih contract did not give any such right, and that dividends commenced only fromn the time the scrip was converted into stock. The holder of a certificate of indebt- edlness convertible into stook cannot claim an interest in a stock dividend until lre has converted the scrip into stook. Miller v. Illinois Central . It., 24 Barb. 812 (1857); Brundago v. Brun- dage, 05 Barb. 897 (1873); asT&#x0027;d, 00 N.

The court in this case, speaking of a dividend of interest-bear- ing securities, said: "That the com- pany had no lawful authority for issu- ing the certificates cannot be doubted." In Merz v. Interior Conduit, etc., 87 Hunl, 430 (1895), the issue of bonds to pay certificates of indebtedness which had been issued as a dividend was en- joined. The dissenting opinion in this case seems the better view. A scrip entitling a person named to bonds may be assigned, even though by its terms it can be assigned only with the assent of the corporation issuing the same. Hubbard v.

Railroad Co., 22 Wall. 001 (1874) Cf. Brundago v. Brundage, 00 N. Y. 544 (187). The clinrater of the scrip in title case Is shown by the resolution authorizing it, as follows: "Wherean, this company has hitherto ex- polded of its earnligs for tle purpose ot con- strucllug and equiplping its road, and In the pur chase of rtil estate and other properties wlth a view to all Increase of its tralni, moneys equal in amiount to eighty per cent. of the capital stock of tih company; and whereas, the several stock- holders of the company aro entitled to evidonce of such oxpendlture, and &#x0027;o reimbursement of the saine at somoe convenient future period: "Now. therefore, resolved, that a crlllilcato signed by the president and treasurer of tiis company be Issued to the stockholders severally, declaring that such stocklolder Is entitled to eighty per cent. of the amount of capital stock held by him, payable ratably with tll other cer- tificates Issued under this resolution, at the op- tion ot the company, out ot its future earnings, with dividends therenn, at the same rates and times as dividends shall be paid on shares of the capital stock of the company, and that such certificates may be, at the option of the com- pany, convertible into stock of the company, whenever the company shall be authorized to Increase Its capital stock to an amount snficlent for such conversion." This was the famous scrip dividend made by the New York Central R R. Co. under the management of Commo- dore Vanderbilt. The form of the certificate was as follows: "THE NEW TOIR EIRK CTIAL RLIROAD COMPANY. " No.-. Inlterest Certificato. " Under a resolution of the board ot directors of this company, passed December 19th, 1868, of which the above is a copy, the New York Cen- tral Railroad Company hereby certifies that A. B., being the holder of - shares of the cap- ital stock of said company, Is entitled to -dol- lars, payable ratably with the other certificates Issued under said resolution, at the pleasure of the company, out of its future earings, with dividends thereon, at the same rates and times
			as divileuds shall be paid upon the share!s o( tho capital stock of said copanlly. "Tills certificate may he transferred on tho books of the company on the surrender of this certficato. " In witness whereof, the said compnny has caused this certificate to be signed by itL preal. dent and treasurer, thil 1lth day of Decemober, 1808.
			"President." At the foot of each certificate there was a form of transfer in blank: "For a valuable consideration, I, A. D., do hereby sell, assign, and transfer all interest in the above certiticato to C. D., and do hereby Irrevocably appoint E. F. attorney, to cxecuto a transfer (hereof on tle books of the railroad company therein mentioned." See Bailey v. Railroad Co., 22 Wall 004, 008 (1874). This dividend was de- clared, although tile company by its charter was limited to ten per cent. dividends. A dividend of scrip-- i , a paper entitling the holder to dividends equal to dividends thereafter declared on the capital stock-is practically a stock dividend, except that the scrip cannot vote, and provision is generally made for taking it up in some manner. Such a dividend was involved in Gordon v. Richmond, etc. . R., 78 Va. 501 (1884). 2 People v. Board of Assessors, 76 N. Y. 202 (1879), affirming s. c, 16 Hun, 190. In this case it was held that the issue of these certificates could not op- erate to relieve the corporation from their obligations to pay their tax upon the surplus, because the surplus re- mained in the hands of the company, and as such was liable to assessment and taxation. See also Bailey v. Rail- road Co., 22 Wall. 604 (1874). See also Gordon v. Richmond, etc. R. I., 78 Va. 501 (1884). 39

			rights of third parties they may be sot aside(.
			Scrip may be practically tile same thing as shares of stock, ox- cept that it has no voting power. It is issued sometimes because the company cannot issue any more capital stock, the whole capi- tal stock being already out; sometimes to avoid taxes, and some- times to increase the transferable shares without giving to the now shares a voting power. If tile interest or dividendsaro payable only from tle protits, the issue of tile scrip is legal whenever a stock dividendl would be legal, that is, wilenever the property of the com- pany is equal in value to the capital stock plus the scrip dividend.
			A property divienld is where property is divided instead of that property being sold for cash and the cash then used to pay a divi- dend.3 A property lividend occurs where a corporation sells all its property to another corporation and takes in payment therefor the stock and the bonds of the purchasing corporation and then makes a distribution of the same among its stockholders. It has been held that any one of its stockholders may object and insist on payment for his stock in cash.4 This, however, is practically a dissolution of the company and a distribution of its assets, a subject which is considered elsewheroe. I While negotiations were pending between two gas companies for their consolidation by one company buying the stock of the other, upon a certain basis of capital and indebtedness, one of them, without the knowledge of the other, passed a resolution declaring a scrip dividend of ten per cent. on its capital stock, thus increasing its in. debtedness by that amount. The cer- tificates were accordingly issued; but after the consolidation, upon a bill filed for that purpose, the scrip was declared void. Bailey v. Citizens&#x0027; Gas Light Co., 27 N. J. Eq. 196 (1870). 2 Where one street railway company takes a lease of the street railways of three other companies on an agreement whereby the stock of the latter com- panies is deposited with a trustee, and the lessee issues "stock trust certifi- cates" therefor, being its obligation to pay a fixed rate of interest per year, with an option on its part to pay the principal sum or not at its option at a specified time, the stock being security
			11
			therefor to be sold by the trustee in case the principal and interest are not paid. this form of financing does not create a debt, and hence such certifi- cates are not subject to taxation as a bond and mortgage. the transaction being really a guaranteed dividend or rental.. Commonwealth v. Union, etc. Co.. 192 Pa. St. 507 (1890). 3 An amendment to the charter may prescribe that unnecessary corporate real estate shall be divided among or partitioned between the stockholders. Merchant t. Western Land Assoc., 56 Minn. 327 (1894). Where a company has in its treasury stock in another company, and distributes it among its stockholders, this is a dividend. Alle- gheny tv Pittsburg, etc. Ry., 179 Pa. St. 414 (1897). Where corporate land is deeded by way of dividend or dis- tribution among stockholders, there is no warranty of title. Olsen v.

D&#x0027;Ooge v. Leeds, 170 Mass. 558 (1I90&#x0027;:, the court saying: "If this company had been a corporation, and had wished to make a dividend of pre- ferred stock to its shareholders, it would have dcne it in just this wiy. There has been )lo dividend .o any money or property among the share- holders There has been merely a change of the form of the ownership in the property by dividing it into two classes, and by making a different pro- vision in regard to dividends for each class, and by giving one class a prefer- ence over the other in its right to the assets on final liquidation. Not a dol- lar&#x0027;s worth of the property of the com-. pany is taken out of the business, or changed in its relation to the business. . . It is plain that the action of the company was like making a divi- (lend of preferred stock. It wasa more formal capitalization of earnings which
			previously had been capitalized in sub- stance and effect." 2A statutory liability for dividends paid out of the capital stook abrogates. all common.law liability, and if such statute does not prohibit such dividends they may be declared and paid subject to such liability.

Keppel v. Peters- burg R. R, Chase&#x0027;s Dec. 167 (18S8); s. c., 14 Fed. Cas 357; Scott v. Central R. R etc. Co., 52 Barb. 45 (1868). In this case two of the three judges held that though the dividends were declared without specifying how they should be paid, yet where they were paid as a matter of fact in depreciated Confeder- ate currency, a northern stockholder could not, after the war, claim the same dividends payable in United States currency. 1141 11.

Iinterest-beariij st(oc1k.-It has already been shown that a corporation may issue stock and may make a contract with the sub- scriber that the company will pay interest upon the sums paid in by tho subscriber.5 Such a contract is legal, however, only when tlh interest is to be paid from the not profits of the enterprise, and not from the capital stock. Unless net profits have been earned the stipulated interest cannot legally be paid. Consequently there is little difference between interest-bearing stock and preferred stock.
			§ 538. To whom t7to corloration is to 1)ay th1 diid(eond.-Tho question as to whom a dividend shall be paid after it has been reg- Barclay, 101 Pa. St. 504 (1800), the va- lidity of a stock dividend whereby a gas company having $300,000 capital stock distributed $800,000 additional capital stook among its stockholders as a stock dividend to represent the en- hanced value of the property was not questioned. A stock dividend is to be counted as a part of the capital stock to sustain a debt of the corporation under a charter which limits the debts to one-half of the capital stock. Cun. ningham v. German, etc. Bank, 101 Fed. Rep. 977 (1900). A stock dividend was sustained in Cole v. Adams, 10 Tex. Civ. App. 507 (1808), to the extent that such dividend represented profits which had been used in the property, but not to the extent that such dividends repre- sented a rise in the value of the prop. erty of the company. In the case of Shaw v. Gilbert, 111 Wia 105 (1901), where a so-called "dividend stock" had been issued, it was assumed, under the circumstances of the issue, that the stockholders receiving the same were liable thereon to corporate creditors with interest from the date of issue. Where the life tenant refuses to pay for increased capital stock which is issued
			at fifty cents on a dollar, the remaining fifty cents being a stock dividend, and the trustee takes the stocl for himself, and ten years have elapsed since the life tenant claimed the stock, the stat- ute of limitations is a bar to his suit to compel the trustee to account for the stock. Matter of Smith, 00 N. Y. App. Div. 340 (1001). 1 Terry v. Eagle Lock Co., 47 Conn. 141 (1879). After cancellation there is no statutory liability on such stock. Hollingshead v.

			considerable dilllculty. It is not always easy to decide which one of two or more clainants is entitled to the dividend.
			The general rule is that tho corporation may pay tie dividend to the person in whoso namo the stock stands registered upon tile cor- porate stock book at thee time tle dividend is declared.&#x0027; It may do so without inquiring whether h&#x0027;o has transferred the stock, and without requiring tie production of the certificate.2 In fact, it is a well-sottled rule that the corporation is protected in paying divi. dends to a recorded stockholder, although he may have transferred his stock, no notice of the transfer having been given to the com- pany.3 B3ut after notice of a transfer the corporation must pay the dividend to the transferee, although no registry has been made.4 1 Brisbane v. Delaware, etc. R. It, 01 N. Y. 20 (1883), amrming 25 Hun, 438 (1881); Donnally v. Hearndon, 41 W. Va. G10 (1895); Jones v. Terre Haute, etc. R. R., 20 Barb. 853 (1850); affirmed, 57 N.

In a few instances there have been attached to certificates of stock what are called "dividend warrants," the object being to enable such warrants to becut off like coupons, and so!d and collected like coupons. A form of such warrants is as follows:

			The right to dividends does not, however, depend upon the issue of the certificate, and tile owner of shares imny claim his dividends though no certilicate has over been issued by tile corporation.&#x0027; Tho corporation is protected if it pay dividends to the administra- tor without notice of a transfer by him.3 Under the statutes of California, even though stock is distributed by executors in accord- ance with a decree of distribution, and the distributees sell the stock and it is transferred on the books of the company, neverthe- less, if the decree is reversed on appeal, the transfers are void and the company is liable for dividends paid in the meantime to such purchasers. In a suit by the executors to recover such dividends the purchasers need not be made parties.4 Where stock in a bank stands in the name of a person for sixty-five years without the identity of the stockholder being known and without dividends being claimed by him, although the bank annually advertised the unclaimed dividends, clear proor of the identity of such stockholder must be given by his alleged descendants who do not produce the certificate of stock.6
			With respect to the dividends on the stock of a married woman, the corporation must pay theml to the husband or not, according to the law of the domicile of the corporation, and not according to the law of the domicile of the married woman.6 The husband, by ISalisbury Mills v. Townsend, 109 Mass. 115 (1871); Cross v. Eureka, etc. Co., 73 Cal. 303 (1887), a case between pledgor and pledgee. See also § 387, supra, and § 543, infra. Cf. Stone v. Reed, 152 Mass. 179 (1890), where a cor- porate creditor sued the treasurer for distributing property among the stock- holders. A corporation cannot inter- plead as between stockholders for the purpose of determining the ownership of stock, there having been no claim made upon it in regard to registry or in regard to dividends. It must be shown also that the company bas not acted in a partisan manner as between the different claimants Hinckley v. Pfister, 83 Wis. 04 (1892). The corpora- tion interpleaded between claimants to a dividend on stock in Amberson v. Johnson. 127 Ala. 400 (1900). Where a stockilolder assigns the future divi-

			§ 539. To whom t7ho dividend belongs.- As between the vendor and vondoo of shares of stock, it is a settled rule that the vendee is entitled to all the dividends on the stock which are declared after the sale of the stock. Even though the transfer has not been recorded, the transforee has a right to the dividends as against the transferrer. The law, moreover, refuses to investigate the ques- tion when the dividend was earned. In contemplation of law the net profits are earned at the instant the dividend is declared. This rule is just, inasmuch as the accrued profits and expected dividends enter into the value and price at which the stock is sold.4 20 Hun, 820. As to the rule in Cali- fornia, see Dow v. Gould, etc. Co., 81 Cal. 029 (1807).

			§ 641. A dividend declared and specifically set apart as a distinct fundl belongs absolutely to the stoo7iolders.- When a dividend out of the earnings of a company has been regularly declared and is holders are not entitled to dividends equally with other stockholders. The basis of the decision was the difference between original stock and increased stock. The court refused to compel the corporation to issue a certificate. Bal- timore, etc. Ry . .

			holder. There is at once a soverance, for the use and benefit of the memlbers of tile corporation, of so much of the accumulated earn- ings as are declared; and the dividend thereafter exists as a sepa- rate fund, distinct from the capital stock or surplus profits. It then becomes tho absolute property of the stockholders.&#x0027;
			Accordingly, whenever a dividend is regularly declared and credited to a depositor it becomes his property, to which lie is en- titled in preference to the creditors of tile corporation.2 If the funds to pay a dividend are placed by the corporation, on deposit at a bank or olsewhere, the deposit is made and remains at the risk of the corporation and not of the stockholders, until a reasonable time after actual notice is given to the latter.3 But it cannot be withdrawn and reclaimed either by the corporation or a receiver of the corporation, since the stockholders acquire, by virtue of the declaration of the dividend, a lien in equity upon the deposit.4

			§ 543. A demand is necessary before the action at law by tle stockholder can bo maintained.3 It has been hold, however, that the commencement of tho suit constitutes in itself a sullicient demanld. Under ordinary circum- stances interest is not recoverable upon dividends which hlavo been declared, but which the stockholder has not claimed. The right to interest arises only upon a demand and a refusal to pay." A stock- holder is not entitled to interest on dividends, oven whore ho has demanded the same after they have been declared, where an attach- ment is pending against his stock.6 Tho statute of limitations begins to run only after demand.7 1 Keppel v. Petersburg IL R., Chase&#x0027;s Dec. 107 (1808); a. c., 14 Fed. Cas. 357. This is the usual remedy where pre- ferred stocklholders sue to have a divi- dend declared. See § 272, supra. 2Van Norman v.

			credited up to the personal accounts of the stockholders, and for nearly twenty years certain stockholders do not claim &#x0027;dividends so credited to them, the statute of limitations is a bar, and, the company having been sold out by authority of a statute, the pro. ceeds are to be divided amlong the stockholders without regard to such past-due and unpaid dividends. The statute of limitations began to run from the time the dividends became payable, and the company is not to be considered as a trustee in that respect.&#x0027;
			The action at law for the payment of a dividend which has been declared slould be against the corporation, and not against the corporate olficers.2 But where the treasurer of an incorporated company withhold a dividend belonging to one of the stockholders on the ground that he himself owned the stock, an action of as- sumlpsit against him individually was sustained.3 In a case where a stockholder had been unjustly deprived of his stock, it was held that he could not sue an individual stockholder to recover a divi- dend which should have been paid to him, but that his action was properly against the corporation.4 In actions on the part of stock- holders to enforce the payment of dividends, the validity or legal- ity of the dividend cannot be questioned by the corporation.5 When a corporation is sued for a dividend by two claimants there- for, it may support a bill of interpleader between them." 9 (1895), it is held that the statute of limitations begins to run against the right of a stockholder to sue for his dividends from the time when his ad- ministrator inquires at the corporate office as to whether all dividends bad been paid to decedent, even though a false answer in the affirmative was made by the corporation. Even though a person subscribes for stock in a turn- pike company in 1857 and he does not claim the stock or dividends, and after seven years does not attend meetings or pay any attention to his interest, and dies in 1868, nevertheless his represents atives may collect the dividends due on the stock and may claim the stock. The statute of limitations is no bar if the company has never notified him that his right to the stock is disputed. Owingsville, etc. Co. v. Bondurant&#x0027;s Adm&#x0027;r, 54 S. W. Rep. 718 (Ky. 1900). Where the charter of a railroad com- pany provides that after the stockhold- ers had received dividends equal to ten
			per cent. per annum on the sums in- vested, and such dividends had equaled the amount invested, the surplus there- after over and above fifteen per cent. dividends should be paid to the com- mon school fund, the state may collect such surplus, and the twenty-year stat- ute of limitations is the only statute applicable. A subsequent statute au- thorizing the attorney-general toinsti- tute suit is constitutional, but not so far as such statute increases the obliga- tion. Terre Haute, etc. R. R. v. State, 65 N.

			§ 545. lThe courts very iarely compel the directors to declare a diridln(d.-Tell board of directors declare the dividends, and it is for the directors, and not the stockhlolders, to determine whether or not a dividend shall be declared.6
			When, therefore, the directors have exercised this discretion and refused to declare a dividend, there will be no interference by the courts with their decision, unless they are guilty of a wilful abuse of their discretionary powers, or of bad faith or of a neglect of duty. It requires a very strong case to induce a court of equity to order the directors to declare a dividend, inasmuch as equity has no jurisdiction, unless fraud or a breach of trust is involved.

Ch. 280 (1844); lRex .t Bank of England, 3 B. &#x0026; Aid. 020 (1810), where the court refused to grant a mandlmlis for an examination of the accounts with a view to compel- ling a dividend. In the case of Burden V. Burden, 159 N. Y. 287, 308 (1809), the court held that so long as the directors are acting honestly and within their discretionary powers in accumulating a surplus in an iron manufacturing corporation, a stockholder must sub- mit, but "if it can be shown that trus- tees of a corporation are guilty of fraud and bad faith in accumulating a large surplus to tihe injury of the stockhold- ers, a court of equity would doubtless interfere." The court in this case re- fused to interfere, although the capital was 2,000.000 and the surplus $1,100,000, $;00,000 of which was in the bank and t 00,000 invested in stocks which were not in a legal sense a surplus, but were capital whose income alone would go to swell the regular dividends of the corporation, and it appearing also that the corporation had paid very large dividends. Where the profits are prop- erly used to pay debts, a guarantor of dividends cannot question the propriety of such use of the profits. Pratte v. Enslow. 48 W.

Grant Locomotive Works, 40 N. J. Eq. 114 (1885), the court sail: "In cases where tile power of the dl- rectors of a corporation is without lim- itation and free from restraint, they are at liberty to exercise a very liberal discretion as to what disposition shall be made of the gains of the business of the corporation. Their power over them is absolute so long as they act in the exercise of an honest judgment. They may reserve of thetn whatever their judgment approves as necessary or judicious for repairs and improve- ments, and to meet contingencies, both present and prospective." In State v. Bank of Louisiana, 0 La. 745 (1834), the court refused to order a bank to declare a dividend although it had profits on hand of about one-tenth of its capital. The court said: "If the board honestly err in these matters, we are not ready to say the courts possess the power to rectify its mistakes." The remedy is in the elections. Courts will not order a dividend to be declared un- less the directors "refuse to declare a dividend when the corporation has a surplus of net profits which it can, without detriment to its business, di- vide among its stockholders, and when a refusal to do so would amount to such an abuse of discretion as would consti- tute a fraud, or breach of that good faith which they are bound to exercise towards the stockholders." A dividend will not be ordered when the profits are invested in the plant and in long- time notes. Hunter t: Roberts, etc. Co., 83 Mich. 03 (180).

			ful neglect, or abuse of discretion.&#x0027; vested discretion as to that matter In the board of directors. A stockholder cannot have a receiver appointed merely because the directors reserved the profits for a surplus instead of dis. tributing thoem by way of dividends. Marcuse v. Gullett, ot. Co., 52 La. Ann. 1888 (1000. 1 Grooff v. Equitable, etc. See., 100 N. Y. 19, 82 (1800). Where Inrge dividends are mado by a manufacturing company, it is entirely within the fair and honest discretion of the directors whether the remaining profits shall bb passed to surplus or used for dividends. McNab v. McNab, etc. Co., 02 Hun, 18 (1801); asf&#x0027;d, 183 N. Y. 087, the court holding also that the fact that a manufacturing company extended its business so as to include iron pipe as well as brass, and loaned money, whicli loans, however, the pres- ident was willing to take up, and had owned government bonds, is not suffi. cient to entitle a stockholder wlho has acquiesced therein to demand that all profits be paid out in dividends. Al- though the road was leased and the floating debt was only $1,000, and the bonded debt, $70,000, was due in seven- teen years, and the other expenses only $6,000, while the company had $30.000 on hand and the regular rental for its road coming in, yet the court refused to order a dividend, in Karnes v. Roch- ester, etc. R. R, 4 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 107 (1807), the court holding also tluat a de- mand must first be made, and that the directors, instead of the company, are the proper parties defendant. In Bar. nard v. Vermont, etc. R R., 89 tMass. 512 (1863), there was a contract to pay dividends, and it was upon this contract that the court based its right to pass upon the ability of tile company to declare a dividend. The court re- fused to order a dividend. In Richard- son v. Vermont, etc. R. R, 44 Vt. 013
			(187S), the court decreed the payment of what was substantially a dividend to the stoolholdors, but stated that an accounting must first be had to ascer- tain whether there was available for that purpose "a fund adequate not only for tle payment of tle claims of the plaintiffT In the cause, but for tih pay- ment of all other stockholders having like claims;" and there "must be a surplus fund over and above what is requisite for the payment of the cur- rent expenses of the business, for dis- charging its duties to creditors, and over and above what reasonable pru. dence would require to be kept in the treasury to meet the accidents, risks, and contingencies incident to the busl- nessof operating the railroad." In Dent v. London Tramways Co., L R. 10 Ch. D. 8314 (1880), the court compelled the company to pay a dividend on the preferred stock, where there were profits available, and the common stock- holders proposed to use all the profits for iong-neglected repairs, the real reason being that there were profits sufficient for a dividend on the pre- ferred, but not on both the common and preferred. The court said that profits meant the "su-plus in receipts, after paying expenses and restoring the capital to the position it was in on the first of January in that year." Where a bill in equity, filed for the purpose of obtaining an accounting and the decla- ration of a dividend, does not clearly make out the existence of a surplus which the directors ought to distribute, the suit will fail. A discovery will not be granted where there is no allega- tion that information is refused, or that the party cannot examine the books, or that a mandamus was inadequate. Wolfe v. Underwood, 96 Ala. 329 (1892). Where the licensor of a patent is to have from a corporation as licensee a certain payment from the net profits, 159

			Profits may also be sot aside for the pymoent of indebtedness, though it is not yet dlue. Where stock is pledged( and the pledgee is in control of the company, nnd, instead of declaring dividends, ho honestly antl intelligently applies the profits to improvements, the pledgor cannot hlold( him liable for not declaring dividends, and for not thus deecreasing the debt for which thl stock was given in Tlledge.3 T&#x0027;lo free exercise of the director&#x0027;s discretion cannot be interlercdl with by the contracts of promoters or original incor- porators as to the disposition of corporate prollts.&#x0027; A court will not compel a foreign corporation to declare a dividenld. Under the New Jersey statute a stockholder may file a bill to compel the declitration of a dividend out of accumulated profits not reserved for working capital by vote of the stockholders, as provided in the statute." A stockholder&#x0027;s bill to compel the directors to declare a dividend under the new Jersey statute must allege that the accu- such payment not to be cumulative und to be subject to provision for a re- serve fund, it is legal for the company to pass a sum to the reserve fund, and also a further sum for depreciation and the cost of licenses. Bagot, etc. Co. v. Clipper, etc. Co., [1902] 1 Ch. 140. I Where a corporation having a large surplus proposed, with tie concur- rence of a majority of the stockhold- ers, to employ the surplus in extend- ing the business, although such exten- sion was opposed by a minority of the stockholders, it appearing that the pro- posed enlargement of the corporate en- terprise was clearly intra vires, it was held on a bill brought by the dissent- ing minority for an injunction against the proposed use of the surplus, and pray- ing a distribution of it among the stock- holders, that the facts were not such as to require the interposition of the court on behalf of the minority. Pratt v. Pratt, 83 Conn. 440 (186C), the court say- ing: - On a question of this sort much must necessarily be left to the discre- tion of the managing directors; and so long as they keep within the objects
			contemplated by the articles of associa- tion, and theexpediture is not unreason- able in reference to the amount of their capital, a court of equity ought very seldom to interfere with them."

Earle, etc., [1902] A. C. 83. In this case the surplus was in- vested in bank shares and mortgages, and such investment was made in the name of a director. The court further stated that such investments should not be in speculative securities. 4 In the case of Matter of Rogers, 161 N. Y. 108, 112 (1800), the court of ap- peals said: "An argument is made. which has the sanction of some of the authorities, to the effect that all of the assets of a corporation are deemed capi. tal until a dividend is declared. We

If they fail to do so, and it clearly appears that they have accumulated earnings not re- quired in the prosecution of the busi- ness, which they withhold from the stockholders for illegitimate purposes, a court of equity may interfere and compel a distribution of such earn- ings." Where two directors, forming a majority of the board, vote them- selves very large salaries, and refuse information to another director who is the only other stockholder, and refuse to declare dividends, and proceed to convey the property of the company to another company controlled by themselves, a court of equity will set aside the illegal conveyances and the resolutions authorizing the salaries, and will order the books to be opened to the other director, and will order divi. dends to be declared. The court, how- ever, will not appoint a receiver and enjoin the continuance of the business, and will not order a distribution of the assets of the company. Laurel Springs Land Co. v Fougeray, 50 N.

It is legal for a coal corporation, with the assent of all its stockholders, to sell all its property to its president, and for him to pay therefor in cash and by a mort- gage on the property so purchased, he also agreeing to pay all the debts of the company. Payment was made directly to the stockholders, and they trans. ferred their stock to him in addition to the transfer of the property.

			In view of the rule that dividends can be made only from prof- without paying the creditors, never- theless a bona flde purchaser of such bonds is protected as against the cor- porate creditors. A former decree in a court of equity against the trustee of the mortgage in regard to the mat- ter does not bind the bondholders, al- though a suit at law against the trus- tee would have bound them. Lebeck v. Ft. Payne Bank, 115 Ala. 447 (1807).

			a corporation constitutes "profits " whlich may be used for a divi. (lend. This question las caused tle courts considerable dilllculty. Tieore have boon various dellnitions, explanations, and different states of facts involved in the cases which have coino before the courts. Tho supronem court of the United States has said that " tile term &#x0027; profits,&#x0027; out of which dividends alone can properly bo de- clared, denotes what remains after defraying every expense, in- cluding loans falling due, as well as the interest on sueo loans."&#x0027; An English court says that profits are " the excess of the current gains over the working expenses as shown by revenue accounts as distinguished from capital accounts." 2 A clear idea of what con- stitutes profits available for dividends can be obtained only by a study of the cases themselves.3 1 Mobile, etc. R. R. v. Tennessee, 153 U.S. 480 (1894). &#x0027;&#x0027;Re London &#x0026; Gen. Banll, 72 L. T. Rep. 227, 220 (1804); air&#x0027;d, [1805] 2 Ch. 100, 078. The House of Lords in Dovey, etc. v. Cory, [1901] A. C. 477, said: "Even the distinction between fixed and floating capital which in an ab- stract treatise like Adam Smith&#x0027;s Wealth of Nations is appropriate enough, may, with reference to a con- crete case, be quite inappropriate. It is easy to lay down as an abstract prop- osition that you must not pay divi- dends out of capital, but the appli- cation of that very plain proposition may raise questions of the utmost diffi- culty in their solution. I desire, as I have said, not to express any opinion, but as an illustration of what difficul- ties may arise, the example given by the learned counsel of one ship being lost out of a considerable number, and the question whether all dividends must be stopped until the value of that lost ship is made good out of the further earnings of the company or partnership, is one which one would have to deal with. On the one hand, people put their money into a trading concern to give them an income, and the sudden stoppage of all dividends would send down the value of their shares to zero and possibly involve
			their ruin. On the other hand, cdm- panies cannot at their will and with. out the precautions enforced by the statute reduce their capital; but what are profits and what is capital may be dimcult and sometimes an almost impossible problem to solve." &#x0027;There is no hard.and-fast rule by which the company can determine what is calp ital and what prollit. It may be safely said that what losses can be properly charged to capital and what to income is a matter for business men to deter- mine, and it is often a matter on which the opinion of honest and competent men will differ. . .. There is no single definition of the word &#x0027;profits&#x0027; which will fit all cases."&#x0027; Bond v. Bar- row, etc. Co., 80 L T. Rep. 10 (19023. 3" Net earnings are, properly, the gross receipts, less the expenses of operating the road to earn such receipts. Interest on debts is paid out of wlat thus remains; that is, out of the net earnings. Many other liabilities are paid out of the net earnings. When all liabilities are paid, either out of the gross receipts or out of the net earnings, the remainder is the profit of the shareholders to go towards dividends, which in that way are paid out of the net earnings."

			Thoro are some general principles connected with this subject which havo been established by tho adjudications. It is not noc- ossary for a railroad or other corporation to use its profits to pay its funded or bonded debt instead of using those profits for a divi- deond. But it is necessary to pay before any dividend is declared.2 Warren v Kilng, 108 U. S. 889 (1898); Vin Dyol v. MoQuado, 80 N. Y. 38, 47 (1H81). "Popularly spealting, the not recelpts of a business nre its profits." EyHtor v. Centennial Board, 94 U. . 500 (187(1). "Surplus earnings" are sail to be the moneys availal)lo for dividends. Willitms v. Western Union Tel. Co., 03 N. Y. 103, 101 (1883). "Net earnings" is i torm synonymous with "net in. come," and also "net income " as used in the statute under consideration. Phillips v. Eastern R. R., 188 Mass. 122 (1884). In Belfast, etc. R. R. v. Belfast, 77 Ie. 445 (1885), it is said that the term "net earnings" does not imply that the company is wholly out of debt. In Park v. Grant Locomotive Works, 40 N. J. Eq. 114 (1885), it is said that prof- its mean " the clear gains of any busi-

In the following cases the term "net profits," or an eruivalent phrase, is defined: Coltness Iron Co. v. Black, L. . 0 App. Cas. 315 (1881); New York, etc. R. R. v. Nickals, 119 U. S. 200 (1880). In Richardson v. Bubl, 77 Mlich. 032 (1889), the court ap- proved of the following statement: "That the first thing to be done by any manufacturer who would ascertain his net earnings during the preceding year is to take a careful inventory of 1 A company has power to and does to construction account; also that a raise its capital both by stock and by sinking fund should be provided and an borrowing.

A corporation often owes largo debts and still has its what lie has loft, including his plant and machinory, and tlion make just and full allowances for all losses and sirinkagoes of every lind that hi has suffered in Ills property during the year, and for all expenses of every kind, ordinary or extraordinary, thalt hlave occurred during the year; and, having madle such Invontory.ind deducted such losses and shrinkage of every kind, his net earnings will be the difference be- tween all his investments in his busi- ness and all his expenses of every kind on the one band, and this now inventory, with the reductions properly made, and all that he has received of every kind, on the other hand; and if his books are properly kept and proper de- ductions made, these net earnings will finally appear on the balance sheet to the credit of the prollt-and-loss ac- count." In Gratz v. Redd, 4 B. Mon. (Ky.) 178, 187 (1848), it is held that cap. ital paid in on stock which is after- wards forfeited does not thereby be- come profits and liable to be distrib- uted as a dividend, also that money paid in as capital must remain and be treated and expended as capital, whether the stock that represents it is forfeited or not. To distribute such money as profits is to squander and dis- sipate the capital stock. " Gross earn- ings " include earnings of the railroad through a transfer company operated by it. Dardanelle, etc. Ry. v. Shinn, 52 Ark. 93 (1889). "The assets, resources, and funds of the corporation must con- si/t of cash on hand and other property, and, if such assets exceed the liabilities, a dividend can be lawfully declared; in other words, a profit exists." Hub- bard v. Weare, 70 Iowa, 678 (1890); Mil. ler v. Bradish, 69 Iowa, 278 (1886). See also McDougall v. Jersey, etc. Co., 2 Hem. &#x0026; M. 528 (1864). IThe funded debt need not be paid
			before divldends are declared, but " any debts whillh lavo boon incurred and which are duo from the directors or the compalny, either for stean-engines, for rails, for completing stations, or the like, whiill ought to have been andl would have been paid at the time, lhad the defendants possessed the ineceuseiry funds for that purpose, those are so many deductions from the profits, which, in my opinion, are not ascer- tained till the whole of them are paid." Corry v. Londonderry, etc. Ry., 29 Beav. 20S, 278 (1800. However, in Stevens v. South Devon Ry., 9 Hare, 313, 326 (1851) a stockholder failed in his suit to en- join dividends until the floating debt was paid. The court said: "I am of opinion that the court ought not, upon this ground, to interfere by injunction. . . . I think also that the question upon this third point is one of internal management, with which the court cannot interfere." In Belfast, etc. I. R v. Belfast, 77 Me. 445 (1885), the court said: "Net earnings are the gross re- ceipts less the expenses of operating the road to earn such receipts; also less the interest on the bonded, funded. per- manent. or standing debt; also floating debts &#x0027; which it is not wise and pru- dent to place in the form of a funded debt or to postpone for later payment;&#x0027; also an annual contribution to a sink- ing fund to pay the funded debt, when the condition of the company renders it expedient, as where the company will at some future time earn only its operating expenses The court also said that whether the floating debt should be paid and a contribution be made to a sinking fund &#x0027; depends upon the financial resources and abilities of the corporation and the prospects of its road,&#x0027; and. further, that the cost of construction may be charged to the capital-stock account." 1107 Oil.

			A proper sum must first be expended or sot asido for repairs and reconstruction to replace depreciation duo to wear and tear.2 In other words, the fund available for dividenls is ascertained by tak- ing into account the cost of repairs and a reasonable allowance for deprecintion, giving credit for all actual permanent improvements.&#x0027; I Tho court will not enjoin a divi- dond where the company shows tliat it has tho necessary profits. oven though there are outstanding claims on illegally issued stock. Carpenter v. New York, etc. R. IL, 5 Abb. Pr. 277 (1857). Whero the company denies that the complhin- ant is a stockholder, a proliminary in- junction falls. Dlatcliford v. New York, etc. I. R, 5 Abb. Pr. 270 (1857). Direot- ors are not liable to replace dividends declared (by reason of a statute mal:ing themn so liable if tile dividends are not "from tie surplus profits"), although dividends were declared while the com- pany, being engaged in mining, as- sumed a mortgage debt in buying addi- tional property, a sinking fund being begun to meet that liability gradually, and although the money to pay the dividend was borrowed, money to that amount having been put into improve- ments, and although losses due to an injunction against using a stream of water were not at once charged up to operating expense. Excelsior, etc. Co. v. Pierce, 90 Cal. 131 (1891). 2In Davison v. Gillies, L R. 16 Ch. D. 347, note (1879), the court, at the in- stance of a stockholder, enjoined the declaration of a dividend on the ground that the street-railway tracks of the company had become worn out, and needed very expensiverepairs, for which no provision had been made by the com- pany, and that this capital so used up must be restored before a dividend was declared. The by-laws prohibited divi- dends except from profits. The court said: "A tramway company lay down a new tramway. Of course the ordi- nary wear and tear of the rails and
			sleepers, and so on, causes a sum of money to be required from year to year in repairs. It may or may not be de- sirable to do tho repairs all at once; but if at the end of the ilrst year the line of tramway Is still in so good a state of repair that it requires nothing to be laid out on it for repairs in that year, still, before you can ascertain the net profits, a sum of money ought to be set aside as representing the amnouit in which the wear and tear of the line has, I may sa:, so far depreciated it in value as that that sum will be required for the next year or next two years.
			. . I should think no commercial man would doubt that this is the right course - that he must not calculate net profits until he has provided for all the ordinary repairs and wear and tear oc- casioned by his business. . . . That being so, It appears to me that you can have no net profits unless this sum has been set aside. When you come to the next year, or the third or fourth year, what happens is this: as the line gets older the amount required for repairs increases If you had done what you ought to have done, that is, set aside every year the sum necessary to make good the wear and tear in that year, then in the following years you woild have a fund sufficient to meet the extra cost." See also, as to construction ac- count, Mackintosh v. Flint, etc. R R, 34 Fed. Rep. 583 (1888). 3 Depreciation at the rate of two per cent. a year was charged in one case, but the directors were held liable under the New Jersey statute for illegally de- claring dividends Whittaker v. Am- well Nat. Bank, 52 N. J. Eq. 400 (1894). 1168 § br0.]

People, etc. t: Roberts, 150 N. Y. 585 (188). In tle case of Bond tv Barrow, etc. Co., 80 L T. Rep. 10 (1902), the court said that it had not been de- cided thai every company ownilng wast- ing property need create a depreciation fund, but it had been decided only that some companies with wasting assets need not have.a depreciation fund. A company owning a mine, lease, or patent may declare dividends out of its net proceeds, although the necessary re- sult is that that much is permanently taken away from the substance of the estate. Excelsior, etc. Co. t. Pierce, 00 Cal. 131 (1891. Judge Lindley, in Ver. ner v. General, etc. Trust, [1894] 2 Ch. 239, 206, said: "But the word &#x0027;profits&#x0027; is by no means free from ambiguity.
			Tho law is much moro accurately ex- pressed by saying that dividends can- not be paid out of capital than by say- ing that they can only be paid out of profllts Theo last expression leads to the inferenco that the capital must al- ways be kept up ani bu represented by assets which, if sold, would produce it; and this is more than is required by law. Perhaps tho shortest way of ex- pressing the distinction which I am endeavoring to explain is to say that fixed capital may be sunk and lost, and yet that the excess of current receipts over current payments may be divided, but that floating or circulating capital must bo kept up. as otherwise it will enter into, and form part of, such ex- cess, in which case to divide such excess without deducting the capital which forms part of it will be contrary to law." In Lambert v. Neuchatel Asphalte Co., 51 L J. (Ch.) 882 (1882), a stockholder sought to enjoin a dividend on the ground that the beds of asphalt belong. ing to tle company were being con- sumed by the company, and that funds sufficient to replace this consumption should be set aside before any dividend was declared. Otherwise the capital would gradually be entirely used up. The court refused the injunction, inas- much as the by-laws of the company gave absolute discretion to the stock- holders to determine the net profits. No creditor&#x0027;s rights were involved in the case. A very full and careful discussion of the right to declare dividends out of a mining property is to be found in Lee v. Neuchatel Asphalte Ca, L R 41 Ch. D. 1, 20, 2, 24 (1889). In that case, how- ever, tle mines were at the time of the litigation more valuable than at the time when the company was formed, and it is to be noticed that the rules laid down expressly assumed that enough property existed to pay all ored- 1170

			a dividend, it is not necessary to take into account the decrease in the value of the ussets and tile impairment of the capital stock of the company prior to that year. The fact that in a year prior to the declaration of the dividend sonic portion of the capital has been lost and has not since been made good affords no ground for re- straining the payment of a dividend out of profits subsequently earned.&#x0027; A corporation " which has lost part of its capital can law- itors after declaring the dividend.

			In Connecticut it is hold that dividends may be declared on pre- ferred stock where the net earnings since the issue of the stock are sulliciont, even though prior to such issue the capital stock had been impaired,2 but that ordinarily, in declaring dividends, the di- rectors are not justified in assuming that the value of property which was originally received in payment for stock is still worth tlat value, and if such property at the time of the dividend was not actually worth the par value of the stock which was issued for it, the dividend is illegal, and a director receiving such dividend as a stockholder may be compelled to pay it back at tile instance of a receiver of the corporation.3 This rule is of course subject to statutory restrictions, as, for instance, in Now York state, where dividends can be made only from "surplus profits."4 A dividend may be declared although tile company has not yet completed its works.5 In the case of railroads, the cost of additional rolling- stock and improvements may be charged to capital account, and need not be paid before a dividend is declared." Where one com- pany buys out another antl agrees to pay a certain salary to an otfi- cer of tile latter, or a lump sum in lieu thereof, such lump sum, if paid, is a part of the capital stock, an(l need not be considered as expenses.&#x0027;

The offer to purchase must be mado pro rnta to all tle preferred stockholders. Under the reserved rights to nmend, alter, or repeal charters, the rights of stockholders among them- selves cannot be impaired, except as required by public interest, but, while it is true that the charter constitutes a contract between the stockholders. yet under this reserved power the legisla- ture may authorize existing corpora- tions to purchase and retire preferred stock and issue in lieu thereof mort- gage bonds, such amendment being construed to be in behalf of the public interest. Where a corporation haschar- ter authority to retire its preferred stock and issue mortgage bondsin lieu thereof, on a vote of the directors and stockhold- ers, a minority stockholder cannot en- join such action on the ground that it would be disastrous in its effect on the corioration.

Accordingly, a dividend paid wholly or partly from the capital stock may be illegal, and may subject the corporation and the stockholders to serious liability. lHence the rule has been firmly established that, where dividends are paid in whole or in part out of the capital stock, corporate creditors, being such when the dividend was declared, or becoming such at any subsequent time, may, to the extent of their claims, if such claims are not otherwise paid, compel the stockholders to whom the dividend has been paid to refund whatever portion of the dividend was taken out of the capital stock.&#x0027; The supreme court of the United States, a foreign corporation, which has neither officers nor place of business in that state, to compel the company to declare and pay dividends according to the stipulations of their certificates of preferred stock.

			A corporate creditor may compel stockholders to refund tho amount received by them on a distribution of the corporate assets upon dissolution or a sale of all the assets of the company, to the extent that his claim has not been paid, after lie has exhausted his remedy against the corporation itself.2 So also the stockholders are not allowed to defraud creditors by bringing about a foreclos- ure and purchase of the property by themselves at a low price which will not pay the corporate debts.3 But this is the extent to 07 Fed. Rop. 000 (1800). Thus, where a company is insolvent, and bondholders have agreed to sell their bonds to a cer- tain party at seventy-five cents on the dollar, and that party then agrees with the corporation to acquire and cancol the bonds and take the property from the corporation for a nominal consider- ation, and after lie has made such agreement the bondholders decline to and proceed to foreclose their mortgage and realize ninety cents on the dollar, the court will not compel the stock- holders to pay to the bondholders the corporate assets which the stockhold- ers have distributed among themselves Brooks v.

			§ 549. Plroccedinls to recover balck sltch7 a (1diidenidl.- It is in general the practice, where dividends have been paid out of the capital stock in prejudice of the rights of corporate creditors, for a judgment creditor, upon the return of his common-law execution against tlh corporation wholly or partly unsatisloed, to comlmence an action in equity on belialf of himsolf and all other creditors who may come in, in the nature of a creditors&#x0027; bill, against tho stockholders to whom thoe dividend iwas unlawfully paid, to recover back so much thereof as was paid out of the capital stock.&#x0027;
			It is a necessary condition precedent to the right to bring this action that a valid judgment shall have been obtained against tho corporation, and that execution thoeron shall have been returned wholly or partly unsatisfied, and this judgment is conclusive as to the merits of the creditor&#x0027;s claim.4 If the treasurer is sued by a atteonpts to, preserve any interest or right of the mortgagor in the property after the sale must necessarily secure and preserve the prior rights of general creditors thereof. This is based upon the familiar rule that the stockholders interest in tle property is subordinate to the rights of creditors; first of se- cured and then of unsecured creditors. And any arrangement of the parties by which the subordinate rights and in- terests of the stockholders are at- tempted to be secured at the expense of the prior rights of either class of creditors comes within judicial denun- ciation."

			Soino cases goes to the full extent of holding the directors liable absolutely for all dividends paid out of capital stock. But the better rule is that, when the directors declare a dividend in good faith and without negligence, they are not to bo held liable merely because the dividend turns out to have impaired the capital stool.1 Direct- l A receiver may recover back a divi- dend paid to a director when the corpo- ration was insolvent, Davenport v. Lines, 72 Conn. 118 (1800): Main v. Mills, 6 Diss. 08, and note (1874); s a., 10 Fed. Cas. 500, whero a dividend paid to the president, but not legitimately earned, was recovered from the president of a bank by the assignee in bankruptcy; Re County Marine Ins. Co., L. R 0 Ch. App. 104 (1870). which was the case of a marine insurance company, wlere the directors declared a bonus on the shares of stock without making out a profit and loss account, and it was held that a director who had received such bonus on a balance sheet thus carelessly drawn up should, in consequence of his neglect of duty, repay the amount to the liquidator. It was the gross neglect of the directors which militated so strongly against them, and both the lord justices declared the court would not have so held had there been bona /ldes and regularity in the declaration of the bonus. Re Denham, L. R. 25 Ch. D. 752 (1883). Here it was held that an innocent director was not personally responsible for the fraudulent reports and balance sheets and the dividends paid under them, and that--having regard to the extraordinary powers vested by the articles in the chairman, and to the fact that the books had been kept and audited by duly authorized officers, and that the director sought to be charged had no reason to suspect any misconduct -he was not liable to repay any of the dividends so received by him, although they were in fact paid out of the capital. Where the directors pay a dividend to themselves only,

			without there being any profits, they must refund the same. Latimer t. Equitable, etc. Assoo., 78 Mo, App. 403 (1808). 2 Excolsior Petroleum Co, v. Lacoy, 03 N.Y. 422 (1875). Directors are not liable to corporate creditors, either at common law or under a statute, for paying divi. dends when they supposed, and the books showed, that the company was prosperous and had profits for distribu- tion, but it subsequently turned out that the president had embezzled the funds and substituted fictitious notes of customers and had falsified the books in omitting debts for material, there being no proof that the directors, even in the exercise of ordinary diligence, would have discovered that the com. pany was insolvent. Chick v. Fuller, 114 Fed. Rep. 22 (1002). Where losses incurred by a banking company during the year are written off, and the balance of the receipts in each year over the outgoings in the same year. after mak- ing some allowance for bad debts and deductions for sums carried over to a reserve fund, is treated as the profit of. that year, and is divided as dividends without making any further provision for the losses of previous years, the di- rectors are not liable on the ground that the dividends were paid out of capital, although this method of pro- cedure would ultimately exhaust the paid-up capital of the company. The discretion of the managers in fixing the losses to be charged to the capital and those to be charged to income is not inquired into by the courts, unless obviously improper charges to capital have been made, in order to increase OU.

			ors are not personally liable for dividends improperly paid, vlwero they honestly believe iln a stat of facts which woull Justify the payment and rely upon the general imnager&#x0027;s certilicato as to the assets.I
			The liouso of Lords in England has recently holl that even though dividends havo been declared and paid illegally, by, reason of the fact that bad debts have not been charged off, yet a director who acted in good faith and relied upon the statements of the officers of the company in voting for such dividends is not liable to repay the same for the benefit of the stookholders.2 But where the di. apparent profitr The directors are not personally liable unless they were oul- pably or grossly negligent in the matter. Even though a director knoiw his nauim was signed to a report to the stock- holders after ho has resigned, yet lie is not liable, where lie took no part in drawing the report or in reconllmending the dividend based thereon. It seems that an ilmproper dividend may be re- covered from tie directors, oven though the creditors have all been paid and the stockholders will have the bonellit of the recovery, they having been ignorant of the fact that the dividends were paid from capital stock. Re National Bank et Wales, [18091 2 Ch. 629, rev&#x0027;g 79 L T. Rep. 00667. In Re MercantileTrading Co., L R 4 Ch. App. 475 (1860), it was held, in accordance with this view, that where the action of a board of directors in making a dividend was bona fide, they are not liable for errors of judg- ment in preparing a balance sheet show- ing the assets of the concern. In this case it appears that the directors in- cluded among the corporate assets a debt due the company by the govern- ment of the Confederate States; some cotton owned by the company but stored within the limits of the Con- federacy; and certain merchant ships engaged in running the blockade, all which were estimated at their full value. These assets being subsequently de- stroyed and lost to the company, its bankruptcy followed. Osgood v. Laytin, 8 Keyes (N. Y.), 521 (1807), was an ac- tion by a receiver to recover dividends
			improperly declared. The court said: "Ignoranco of fiets that it was the duty of the managers to know - not to know which was gross ignorance-can- not excuse the managers and impart any virtue or validity to acts otherwise clearly illegal, and which were a pal. pable fraud upon the creditors" But the directors of a bank are not liable for dividends declared in good faith, even though it subsequently turns out that debts to the bank whlich they con- sidered good were found to be bad. Witters v. Sowles. 31 Fed. Rep. 1 (1887). However, the court in Re Oxford Build- ing, etc. Soc., 55 L T. Rep. 598 (1886), say it is settled that "directors who improperly pay dividends out of capital are liable to repay such dividends pel- sonally upon the company being wound up; "that the company, or a creditor, or a liquidator may enforce it: that the acquiescence of the stockholders does not affect creditors; that the statute of liquidations does not apply; and that the innocent intent of the directors is no defense. The directors are not per- sonally liable for dividends declared, even though, in estimating the assets, claims are included which ultimately prove to be bad, the result thereby being that the dividend was paid out of the capital.

L Cas. 497. 531 (1849), Lord Brougham said: "I beg to be understood as going with those who view with the greatest severity the conduct of railway direct- ors in declaring dividends which can only be paid out of capital, because I
			(75) 11
			consider that that is of Itself a most vicious and fraudulent course of con- duct. It Is telling the world that their profits aro large wlhen it may be that their profits are 71ii, or that their losses are large&#x0027; vith no profits. It Is a falso and fraudulent representation by act and deed, much to be reprobated; and I gd the full length of what myn noble and learned friend has laid down, that It would be a just ground, if a course of conduct of this sort were pursued, coupled with such circumstances as clearly to show a fraudulent intent, for proceedings of a graver nature against these parties." The payment of a divi- dend out of the capital stock is dltra vires. Accordingly, where the directors mislead the stockholders by represent- ing in the reports and balance sheets, as good, debts which they know to be bad, and thus knowingly pay dividends which in fact impair the capital stock, it is not a defense that the stockhold- ers, relying in good faith upon the rep- resentations and reports of the di- rectors, pass resolutions declaring the dividends at regular meetings of the corporation; and an action will lie on behalf of creditors to compel the di- rectors to refund. In such an action the directors cannot set off any money due from the company to them, nor have they recourse to the stockholders who took the dividends bona fide. Flit- crofts Case, L. R 21 Ch.

They will be hold liable from the date when a prudent man would not have included In the profits unpaid interest. Each director is liable only for dividends declared or recommended at meetings whlln he was present.2 Fre- quently, when a dividend is paid out of the capital stock, the di- rectors are made liable tllerefor by statute without reference to any fraud or fraudulent intent on tleir part.&#x0027; A court of equity has power to entertain a suit to enforce the statutory liability of di- rectors for paying dividends in violation of such statute, where there is no other remedy in any other court, even though the money is not needed to pay the company&#x0027;s debts.

			officials, and are liable for dividends improperly paid, based on balance shoots improperly made up by the auditors, especially where the auditors included as regular investments loans for which there was no proper security.2 The manager of a corporation who makes up the accounts may also be liable for dividends illegally de- clared.&#x0027; After dissolution has been decreed it is too late for a cor- porate creditor to bring an action to hold the directors liable for declaring dividends out of the capital stock, no fraud in obtaining the dissolution being alleged.4
			Under certain circumstances, in the absence of actual fraud, the directors who have been compelled to pay the claims of corporate creditors may in turn recover what they have paid in an action against the stockholders.&#x0027; And claims against directors who are made liable by statute in these cases may, in the absence of actual fraud on their part, be barred by laches or the statute of limita- tions.6 A statutory liability in reference to illegal dividends may not survive the death of a director who is liable.&#x0027; &#x0027; Keen v.

			an insolvent corporation to hold a director liable for dividends paid out of tile capital stock. The remedy Is in equity.&#x0027; A suit to hold the directors liable for declaring a dividend out of the napital stock and thereby inducing the plaintill to purcllase the stock cannot at the same time seek to hold the directors liable to the corporation for the dividend so declared.l
			§ 551. gaurlity of dividends by contraot.-A guaranty of divi- dends is often made by the corporation itself that issues the stock. The stock is then called guaranteed or preferred stock. This class of stock is fully considered elsewhere.&#x0027;
			A guaranty of dividends frequently is made by a third person. Such a guaranty is often madc when one person sells stock to an- other and guarantees that the corporntion will pay certain divi- (lends thereon. It often arises, also, where one company buys out another or leases the property of anotler corporation and guaran- tees dividends on the stock or the interest on the bonds of the lat- ter. This subject, also, is considered elsewhere.&#x0027; A foreclosure brought about for the purpose of cutting off a guaranty of the bonds of another corporation is illegal, the real purpose being to allow other creditors of the corporation and the stockholders to obtain the property free from such guaranty."

			rule. - 5l0, Miscellaneous questions herein. 055. The Massaolihusetts rule. § 552. The sTuildjct.- Whore shares of stock are held by an estate, and the income of the estate is to go to a life tenant for life, and the remainler to another party, the question of whether the life tenant or the remainderman is entitled to a stock dividend o .x- traordinary cash dividend is a perplexing one. The stock divi- dend or extraordinary cash dividend may represent prolits which wore earned or accumulated before the life tenancy began. In that case it is clear that in justice the remainderman should receive it. If, however, it was earned after the life tenancy began, it is clear that the life tenant should have it. If it was earned partly before and partly after the life tenancy began, then it is apparent that in justice soine apportionment should be made if possible.
			&#x0027;Tle courts, however, differ widely in laying down rules on this subject. Tlleso diiferenocs form the subject of this chapter.

If it is found to have accrued or boon earned before the lifo estate arose, it may be hold to be principal, and, without reforeneo to tho time when it is declared or made payable, to be- long tb tile cortus of the estate, and not to go to the life tenant. But whon it is found that the fund, out of which tho dividend is paid, accrued or was carned, not before but after the lifo estate arose, then it may be hold that the dividend is income, and belongs to the tenant for life.&#x0027; The court will also take into consideration the custom and regularity of the corporation In accumulating its surplus, inasmuch as tile testator may be presumed to have ex- pectel tie corporation to continue its accumulation of a surplus or to provide for improvements out of profits. This equitable rule prevails not only in Pennsylvania, where it seems to have been first clearly declared, but also in many other jurisdictions.&#x0027; t EIrpl&#x0027; Appeal, 28 Pa.

			gradually disappoars as they come nearer to being duo. A stock dividend representing aicouuulatod prollts goes to the life tenant, the court stating that the question is always to be decided according to tile actual facts of tle transaction. Tile New York court of a)p peals says: "F or all corporate purposes the corporation may doubt- less convert earnings into capital, when such power is conferred by its charter; but wlhen a question arises between life tenants and re- niaindlornmen concerning the ownership of thle arnings thus con- vcrted, the action of the corporation will not conclude the courts."&#x0027; of its working capital for $S.7n0,000 of the cal)pitl stook of a now corpora. tion. and rotained certain oash, bonds, stockts and Hurplus lands wlhiol it pro. eooded to distribute among its stook. holders, tho court hold that the plant and working capital wore practically capital stock, but that the cash, bonds, stocks, and surplus lands wore income that went to the life tenant. Matter of Rogors, 101 N. Y. 108 (1809). The words "capital" and "profltH," as used in connection with life estates and re- i ,&#x0027;::,icrs in stocks, have a different moaning from what they havo in de. turmiling the right of a corporation to deolare dividends. In passing upon the relativo Interests of a remainder. uman and life tenant in sHiares of Htock and tie dividends therefrom, the courts will hoimetilmle include in capital atoek, extunsions, hlnprovemoents,l plant, and worlking capital wlilcl haveo boen oh. tallm d furom paltl prollts and rnot fromn sul*liri,&#x0027;lllon tI the ical)ital stoclk.

			In Now Jersey the reasonable and logical rule is laid down that ia cash dividend fro onearnings is apportioned between tile co2)1rs of the ostato and tlhe life tenant, in tile prolortion of thi lapso of timo since the last dividend, unless proof is given that such dlivi- dend was earned not day by day but at irregular times. Tilo trus- tee is justifled in distributing the dividend on this basis unless notice by an interested party is given him not to do so.&#x0027;
			§ 555. T&#x0027;he Mlttsanvli.t.Cs trule.-This rule, which prevails in Massachusotts, Georgia, and Rhode Island, is sometimes called " the rule in Minot&#x0027;s Case." It regards cash dividends, whether large or small, as incomo, and stock dividends, whenever earned and how- ever declared, us capital, and the rule, accordingly, is a simple one. Cash dividends belong to the tenant for life and stock dividends to the corypus.&#x0027; There is little doult, however, tiat this rule works great hardship and injustice in many cases. llenco the rule is not rigidly adhered to, but the court, in deciding whether the distri- bution is a stock or a cash dividend, may consider tile actual and substantial character of the transaction, and not its nominal char- acter mnerely.3 I Lang t. Lang&#x0027;s Ex&#x0027;r, 57 N. J. Eq. 32.5 (1898), rev&#x0027;g 50 N. J. Eq. 003 (1898). The court held that there was no dif- ference botween ordinary and oxtraor- dinary dividends so far as this right of apportionment Is concerned. The court said: " Wo think that when a divi- dend is declared out of earnings, the reasonable presumlption is that those earnings have been made uniformly, day by (day, since the last sHiilar divl. deiul wits dcliarecd, leaving tile pirties In interest at liberty to show that the earniings, wure really minado dliieroiitly.

			LIFE ESTATEB AND ItEMAINDER8 IN STOK1 [Oil. XXXIII. Tho suprome court of the United States has hold that a life ten- ant of stook does not tako a stock dividend declared during tho life tenancy.&#x0027; theroof, the interest on the bonds to be paid only from the Income from tho ueourities after paying tho debts, such bonds do noli belong to a lifo&#x0027;toianlt, but belong to the romaindlrinon. D&#x0027;Oogo v. Leeds, 170 Mass 558 (1000), the court saying: "In considering tho distrilbtion to determino its character, substanoo, andl not form, is regarded. The simple question in every case is whether the distribution made by tbe corporation is of money to be spent as Incooe, or capital to be held as an in- vestment in the corporation. While this arbitrary rule may sometimes de. feat the intention of the testator, in most cases it aecolnplishes the result Intended, and there were practical con. sideratlons, as well as principles, which required thi adoption of it." Also, "Our court does not inquire further than to ascertain whether the distribu. tion is of money to be used as income, or as of capital, to be continued in the business" The court said also that this was substantially the rule in England, and the rule laid down by the supreme court of the United States. In Daland v. Williams, 101 Mass. 571 (1800), where tlto directors, having voted to increase the capital stock by three thousand shares, declared a cash dividend of forty per cent., and authorized the treasurer to receive that diidend in payment for two thousand eight hun. dred of tile shares, the remaining two hundred shlres to be sold, thecourt held that the transaction was virtually a stolc dividend, and that the shares must go to the remainderman&#x0027;s fund. Cf. Rand v. Hubbell, 115 Mass 401(1874). In L.eland v. IIayden, 103 Mass, 542 (1800), where it appeared that the company had Invosted its surplus earnings in its own stock, naln subsequently declared a dividend of that stolc, the life ten.
			nnt was hold absolutely entitled to It. The life tenant takes tho dividend whero It is In cash, although the cash Is dorivoel from increased stock which is offered to the old stookholders for subscription, the profits having been used for improvements. This is not a stock dividend. Davis v. Jaokson, 152 Mass. 58 (1800) See also Baloh v. Ild. let. 70 MInss 402 (1858); Reed v. Head, 88 Mass. 174 (1808); Harvard College v. Amory, 20 Mass. 440 (1830); Giford v. Tlompson, 115 MasI 478 (1874); HenmI enway V. Ilemenway, 1841 Mss. 440 (188). In New England Trust Co. v. Eaton, 140 Mass, 583 (1880), it was held, in an elaborate opinion by Dovens, J., that the gain or loss arising from the sale of stock held in trust is the gain or loss of tie corpus, and that the sum received constitutes a new principal. Accordingly, a trustee who has in- vested in bonds at a premium may re- tain,nnnually from the income payable to the life; tenant such sums as will re- store to the fund at its maturity what was taken therefrom at the time of the investment. See also the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in this case; and cf. Bowker v. Pierce, 130 Mass. 202 (1891); Dodd v. Winship, 133 Mas. 859 (1882); Wright v. White, 130 Mass. 470 (1884); Parsons v. Winslow, 10 Mass. 301 (1820); Lovell v. Minot, 37 Mass. 116 (1838). The court will take into consideration, in determining the question as between life tenant and remainderman, the whole character of the transaction, and the nature and* source of tle property distributed, with due regard to all the facts preceding, attending, and resulting from the dec- laration of the dividend. In HI .rd v. Eldridge, 100 Mass. 258 (1872), it is aid: "The suggestion that the intention of the llrectors should determine the i (ibbonl, . Mllahon, 1&#x0027;3J U. H.40(1800).

			In Rhode Island the courts have adopted a rule somewhat like " the rule in Minot&#x0027;s Case," without the modification engrafted upon it by the subsequent decisions of the Massachusetts courts. It is a rule which in general prefers the remaindorman to the life tenant.&#x0027;
			§§ 550, 557. Tlhe Elnglislh rulo.- In England an ordinary, rogu- lar, usual cash or stock or property dividend belongs to the lifo tenant, while an extraordinary cash or stock or property dividend belongs to the corpu. of the trust. This rule was established in England in 1709. question whether the dividend is cap. ital or Income cannot be corroot.... It is more safe to look at the charactor of the property and tho transaction." See throe interesting and valuable little pamphlets by "A Layman," wherein the merits of tho question are fully and learnedly discussed, and en. titled respectively "Common Sense versus Judicial Legislation;" "Stock Dividends; the Rule in Minot&#x0027;s Case Again Restated with Variations by the Supreme Judicial Court of Blassaohu. setts," and "A Third Chapter on the Rule in Minot&#x0027;s Case." (N. Y.: 0. P. Putnam&#x0027;s Sons.) See 5 Am. L Rev. 720; Perry, Trusts (3d ed.), G§ 544, 545, and notes. In Georgia the code is con- strued so as to follow the Massachusetts rule. Millen v. Guerrard, 07 Ga. 284 (1881); Ga. Code, § 2256. l Parker v. Mason, 8 R L 427 (1867); Bushee v. Freeborn, 11 R. I. 1-4 (1875); Brown&#x0027;s Petition, 14 R I. 371 (1884). A stock dividend is capital and not in- come. Greene v. Smith, 17 . L 28 (1890). 2The courts, perhaps uniformly, in- sist upon this distinction. Extraordi- nary dividends may be either of cash or stock, and appear under a variety of names, such ts " participations,"" dis- tributions," or, more commonly, "bo- nuses." See Witts v. Steere, 13 Ves. Jr. 303 (1807); Norris v. Harrison, 2 Mladd. 208 (1817); Hooper v. Rossiter, McClel. (Exch.) 527 (1824). To the point that regular dividends, though increased in amount, go as iuconle to the owner of
			the life estate, see Barclay v. Walne- wright, 14 Ves. Jr. 00 (1807); Price u Anderson, 15 Sim. 473 (1847); Bates v. Mackinloy, 31 Beav. 280 (1802), a cash dividend; to the point that "extra" or unusual dividends, whether of cash or shares, go to augment the principal of the trust fund, see Irving v. Houstoun, 4 Pat. t. L. Cas. 521 (1803), a stock divi- dend; Hooper v. Rossiter, MeClel. (Exch.) 527 (1824), a stock dividend; Re Barton&#x0027;s Trust, L. R 5 Eq. 238 (1808), a stock dividend; Paris v. Paris, 10 Ves. Jr. 185 (1804), a cash dividend; Clayton v. Greshalm, 10 Ves. Jr. 288 (1804), a cash dividend; Witts v. Steere, 13 Ves.

			Thore nro, however, cases in England to tho effect that extra- ordinary oasl dividends may bo deorood to belong to tho life ten- ant.&#x0027; There of course is no question that ordinary cash dividends belong to tlhe life tenant.2 This rule applies oven though it may bo shown that the dividend in question wis earned, wholly or in part, before the commencement of the life estate."
			Whore it is shown that dividends havo been fraudulently retained in prejudice of the rights of the lifo tenant, and subsequently a was hold that the promium on a lease of part of a trust estate belonged to the tenant for life and not to the corlps. An executor may plainly transfer the stool to pay the decedent&#x0027;s debts, al- though it Is bequeathed for life with re- mainder over. Franklin v. Bank of England, I Russ. 575 (1820, In Clive v. Clive, Kay, 600 (1854), by the terms of the deed of settlement the net profits of tle concern were to be divided rata- bly to suoh an amount as should be deo clared at the semi-nnnual meetings, and were to be paid within twenty-one days thereafter: and it was provided that a stockholder was not to receive any dividend after the period at &#x0027;bhioh he ceased to be a proprietor of a.ares, but the dividends on such shares were to continue in suspense until some other person should become proprietor of them. When a stockholder died sixty-nine daysaftera half-yearly meet- ing at which a dividend had been de- clared, but before notice had been given that such dividend was payable, having by his will bequeathed the in- terest and annual income arising from all his shares to one for life, and then in remainder to others, it was held that this dividend belonged to the legatee for life, and not&#x0027;to the general personal estate of the testator. See also Title to Dividends, 10 Am. L Rev. 571; Bostock v. Blakeney, 2 Bro. Ch. 653 (1789); 2 Perry, Trusts, §§ 544, 545. Mr. Monk&#x0027;s note, 11 Eng. Rep. 828-332; Browne v. Collins, L. R. 12 Eq. 580 (1871), is to the effect that profits of a partnership ac- crued and earned before, but not set nside lqu plrofits until after the death of the testator, belong to the corpus of
			the estate, and that profits accruing after his death go to the tenant for life as incoiue See also tle important re- view of the whole subject in Bouolh v Sproule, L. R. 12 App. Cas. 885 (1887), reversing the court below, Sproule v. Bouol, L. R. 20 Ch D. 085 (1885).
			i In Sugden v. Alebury, L. R. 45 Cb. D. 237 (1890), the court held that the life tenant was entitled to an extraordinary dividend payable in cash. The dividend was called a bonus, but was nothing -:iore or less than a large dividend, he- ing a division of accumulated profits In Ellia v. Barfleld, 04 L. T. Rep. 025 (1891), the court held that a large divi. dend was income and belonged to the life tenant, although it was used by the trustee to pay up the stock in full, and also to purchase new shares which he immediately sold; but thp excess for which lie sold the stock at ,a profit be longs to the remainderman. 2A cash dividend of prot:s which have been earned since the last Freced ing dividend, such last preceding divi. dend having been made in a regular anti reasonable time previously, belongs to a life tenant of stock, and,not to the remainderman.

			[§ 558. bonus is paid upon the shares, it belongs, as income deferred, to tho tenant for life, oven though it bo called a bonus.&#x0027; Tho life tenant does not take any part of the surplus valuo of shares upon distribu- tion after dissolution, if such surplus was clearly capital.2
			In all cases, howevor, the intent of the grantor or testator is the polo-star, and will bo carried out by the courts.3
			§ 558. ThI tppoi&#x0027;ltioenmcnt of divi(led:.-- When a lifo tenant dies before the date at which a dividend is declared, the question arises whother the dividend declared next after his death ought or ought not to bo apportioned between tile roversioner or remnindermlan and tho estate of tho life tenant for the period of time partially covered by tho life estate. It is, in general, tile rule in suchl a caso that the dividend is not apportionablo, but belongs entirely to the cor&#x0027;lus of the trust fund.4 But where a tenant for life dies after the dividend is declared, but before the dividend becomes due, his estate will be entitled to the whole of that dividendl.

The life tenant takes a dividend paid immediately after the death of the testator, where tle will provides that each share bequeathed by the will should carry the dividend ao- cruing at the time of the testator&#x0027;s death. sag v.Lysa ghv. Ly t, [1898]1Ch. 115 (1807). 4Pearly v. Smith, 3 Atk. 200 (1745); Sherrard v. Sherrard, 3 Atk. 502 (1747); Wilson v. Harman, 2 Ves. Sr. 072 (1755j; Hartley r. Allen. 4 Jur. (N.

Thus, a life tenancy in stock for the support of the testator&#x0027;s widow and children was held to entitle the widow&#x0027;s estate to a dividend de- clared after her death, but for a period which expired before that event. John- son v. Bridgewater Mfg. Co., 80 Mass. 274 (1859). See also Ellis v. Essex Merri- mack Bridge, 19 Mass. 243 (1824); Gifford v. Thompson, 115 Mass. 478 (1874. Cf. King v. Follett, 3 Vt. 385 (1831), in which the residuary legatee claimed from the legatee of certain stock the share of dividends earned in the life- time of his testator, but declared after his death; the court holding that a sale or gift of stock carries with it all divi- dends declared after it takes effect, whether earned before or not.

			under the statute known as the Apportionment Act of 1870, divi- dends are apportionable in those cases between the estate of the life tenant and the conutw; &#x0027; and in this country at common law, in one or two jurisdictions, there is a tendency to hold that dividends are apportionable.&#x0027; In Maryland a stock dividend has boon appor- tioned.&#x0027; At the termination of the life estate no claim can be made in behalf of the life tenant for inoreaso in the value of the stock, no dividends having boon declared.4
			§ 5s59. The ri7ght to subscribe for now shares as between life ten- ant acnd reomaindermana.-lThe right to subscribe for new shares at par upon an increase of the capital stool, which is an incident of the ownership of the stock, does not belong as a privilege to the life tenant, but such an increment must be treated as capital, and be added to the trust fund for the benefit of the remainderman. This is equally the rule whether the trustee subscribes for the new stock for the benefit of the trust or sells the right to subscribe for a valuable consideration. In either event the increase goes to the

These are, first, by a tax on the franchise; second, on the capital stock; third, on the real estate and personal property of the corporation; fourth, by a tax on the shares of stock in the hands of the stock- holders.&#x0027; There is another mode of taxation which is sometimes adopted-a tax on corporate dividends; but since this is generally construed to be only a method of valuing the franchise or capital stock, it can hardly be called a fifth method of taxing corporate interests.2
			It is entirely within the discretion of the legislature to say which one of these four methods of taxation shall be adopted, where the matter is not regulated by the state constitution. Xot only this, but it is also within the discretion of the legislature to tax the cor- poration in two or more of these ways -to levy a double tax on the corporate interests, and even to levy a treble or quadruple tax thereon. 12 Redfeld, Railw.

			A. TAXATION OF 8IIAKIBS OF STOCK. 5602. RrJietion of stockholde7rs to the first tLred mc7lhods of tax- ation.- The stockholders in a corporation have very little to (do directly with any of the first three modes of taxing corporate inter- ests. Tho tax is levied directly against the corporation, and is paid by tlho corporate offoiers out of the treasury of the corpora- tion. If the tax is unnuthorized or illegal, or improperly assessed, or is based on too high a valuation, it is ordinarily the duty of the corporate ollicers to rectify or oppose such tax. &#x0027;The stockholders have nothing to do with the ordinary transaction of corporate business, of which this forms a part. Where, however, the corpo- rate officers refuse, upon request of one or more stockholders, to oppose or decline to pay an unauthorized tax levied in any one of the th-eo methods mentioned above, tile stockholder himself may bring a suit in a court of equity, in behalf of and for the protection of the corporate interests, to enjoin the payment and collection of such unauthorized tax.&#x0027; &#x0027;Dodge v.

			§ 508. Tax o ss o are f stock as (dstiinYuislu&#x0027; from the olter lllethots.-A tax on shares of stock is cloarly different from a tax upon the franchise, the corporate property, or the capital stock. Especially is it important to distinguish a tax on shares of stock from a tax on the capital stock.&#x0027; Tle latter is always taxed against the corporation, is paid by the corporation, and is based on a valu. tion which d(oos not necssarily depend on tho value of the shares of stool:. A tax on the shares of stock is generally levied directly against the stockholders themselves at their place of residence, is lIn Porter v. Rookford, etc. R. R., 70 Il. 501 (187.), the court clearly recog- nized this distinction, and said: "The legal property of the shareholder is quite distinct from that of the corpo- ration, altl:hugh the shares of stock have no value save that which they derive from the corporate property and franchise, and a tax levied upon the property of the one is not, in a legal sense, levied upon the property of the other." See also Bradley v. Bauder, 80 Ohio St. 28 (1880) Cf. Delaware R. i. Tax, 18 Wall. 200. 230 (1873); Farrington v. Tennessee, 05 U. S. 670 (1877), where the distinction is clearly drawn; Quincy Bridge Co, v. Adams County, 88 I11. 015 (1878). In North Ward Nat. Bank v. Newark, 89 N. J. L. 880 (1877), the court said: " The moneyed capital of a bank is an entirely different thing from its cap ital stock. The former is the property of the corporation. It may consist of cash or bills discounted, or be in part in. vested in real estate or in the securities of federal government. In whatever form it is invested, it is owned by the bank as a corporate entity and not by the stockholders. The stock or shares represent the interests of the shareholders, which entitle them to participate in the net profits of the bank in the employment of its capital, and is a distinct and independent in- terest or property in the shareholders, held by them like other property." .The case of Porter v. Rockford, etc. R. R., 70 III. 501 (1875), holds also that a tax on the &#x0027; capital stock" means the prop- erty of the corporation and not the ag-
			gregato of the shares of stock. See also State v. Hamilton, 5 Ind. 810 (1854), where the word ", stock" &#x0027;was construed to mean the tangible property of the corporation. But see Trask v. Ma- guire, 18 Wall. 391 (1873). and g 8, san pra, where the word "stock" is de- fltied. And even though the value of the capital stock is estimated by the aggregate value of the shares, it is still a tax on the capital stock. New Or- leans, etc . R. v. Board of Assessors, 83 La. Ann. 10 (1880). See also State Bank v. Richmond, 79 Va. 118 (1884). So also where the franchise is valued in that manner for taxation. Commonwealth v. Hamilton Mfg. Co., 4 Mass. 298 (1800): Att&#x0027;y-Gen. v. Bay State Min. Co.. 00 Mass. 148 (1808). Hamilton Co. v. Mas- sachusetts, 0 Wall. 632 (1807), holds that a tax on the excess of the market value of the stock over the value of the cor- porate realty and machinery is a fran- chise tax. InIndiana it is held that a tax on the shares of stock is the proper mode of taxation unless the statute provides otherwise. Whitney v. Madi- son, 23 Ind. 331 (1804). Cf. Wright v. Stelz, 27Ind. 338 (1800). The mere fact that the corporation is compelled to pay the tax does not prevent its being con- sidered a taxon the shares. National Bank v. Commonwealth, 9 Wall. 353, 800 (1809), per Miller, J. Stockholders are liable for taxes levied on a distillery where the statute levies the tax on "persons interested in the use of the distillery."

			based on tlhe market value of the stock, and is entirely distinct from the location, interests, property, or taxes of the corporation itself. There are, however, some instances of taxation heroin which are on the bordeorline between the two. Thus, a statute expressly lay- ing a tax on the shares of stock, but requiring the corporation to pay that tax from the corporate funds, has been hold to be a tax, not on the slarcs of stock, but on the capital stock. In other juris- dictions it has boon held to be a tax on the shares of stock. Taxes on shares of stock in national banks are frequently so levied and collected, and are held to be upon the shares of stock and not on the capital stock.&#x0027; A tax laid on shares owned by non-residents of the state which creates the corporation and which levies the tax is a tax on the shares of stock and not on the capital stock, even though the corporation is required to pay it and to collect the same from the owners of those shares. A state may tax the shares of stock of a corporation, even though a part of its assets consist of United States bonds.2
			§ 504. Tax by a state or municipality on stockholders residing in the state creating the corploration.-The right of the state to tax resilent stockholders of a resident corporation on their shares of stock is undoubted, and has been unquestioned except where double taxation would result therefrom and is prohibited; or where a con- stitutional provision restricts this mode of taxation.3 Generally such a tax on resident stockholders is levied on them, not in the municipality where the corporation is, but in the cities, counties, or towns where the stockholders respectively reside. This is always the rule if the statute is silent, and is the rule unless the statute expressly provides otherwise.4 1 See § 570, infra. 2 Cleveland T. Co. v. Lander. 184 U. S. 111 (1902). 3In Illinois, under the act of 1872 taxing railroad corporations, resident stockholders in domestic corporations are not taxed. Porter v. Rockford, etc. R. R, 70 II . 501 (1875). In Iowa stock is taxed under § 813 of the Code. See Cook v. Burlington, 59 Iowa, 251 (1882); Henkle v. Keota, 68 Iowa, 834 (1880). Cf. National State Bank v. Young, 25 Iowa, 311 (1808). In Iowa, where de- ductions for debts are allowed to per- sons taxed on their "credits," no de- duction is allowed from the tax on shares of stock. They are not " credits." Bridgman a. Keokuk, 72 Iowa, 42 (1887).

			Controversies sonmtimes arise as to tlh power of a municipality to tax stockliolders living in the state, but not in the municipality which levies a tax on their shares of stock, the corporation itself being located within that municipality. The law plainly is that such a tax is unauthorized, illegal, and not collectible, unless tlh municipality is authorized by statute to levy the tax.&#x0027; A mere general authority to the municipality to tax all property within its boundaries will authorize a tax by it of shares of stock owned by persons living within it.2 But such authority does not sustain a tax on stockholders residing out of the municipality, although within the state. The location of such shares of stock, as property for purposes of taxation, is not whore the corporation is located, but where the stockholder lives.&#x0027; The statutes of the state may change this situs of the stock so as to render it taxable where the corporation is; but unless there is a statute to that effect, such a tax ly a municipality is unauthorized and void.
			§ 565. Tax onl resident sto7ehoeo7ers in a non-resident orforeign corlporation.- It is undoubtedly within the constitutional Dower of the legislature of a state to enact a statute that persons residing in that state, who are stockholders in a corporation created by an- other state, shall be taxed on their shares of stock at their residence ant at the time of his death, and shares held by trustees are taxed in the towns in which the cestuis qote trust respect- ively reside. Revere v. Boston, 123 Mass. 375 (1877). As to the legal rem- edy in Massachusetts for an unjust val. unation of stock for taxation, see Boston Mfg. Co. v. Commonwealth, 144 Mass. 598 (1887). As to taxation of stock un- der tle Vermont law, see Willard v. Pike, 59 Vt. 202 (1887). 1 A city has no inherent power to levy a tax on the capital stock of a cor- poration. Macon v. Macon Constr. Co., 94 Ga. 201 (1804); Stetson v. Bangor, 56 Me. 274 (1808), the court saying: "Mu- nicipalities can tax shares of stock only when authorized so to do by some law of the state. They are.the creatures of state law, and derive their powers in this respect solely from state enact- ments;" Griffith v. Watson, 19 Kan. 23 (1877); Evansville v. Hall, 14 Ind. 27 (1850); Conwell v. Connersville, 15 Ind. 150 (1860). Such a tax may be levied under a general power of the munici-
			pality to tax property. Gordon t: Mayor, etc., 6 Gill (Md.), 281 (1847). Cf. Richmond v. Daniel, 14 Gratt. (Va.) 385 (1858); Augusta v. National Bank, 87 Ga. 020 (186S., Markoe v. Hartranft, 6 Am. L. Reg. (N. S.) 487 (1807), holds that in Pennsylvania such a tax is uncon- stitutional, and that a tax must be levied where the stockholder resides. See also Craft v. Tuttle, 27 Ind. 382 (1806). 2 But a municipality can levy a tax only when specially authorized so to do, and can tax only such property as the statute permits it to tax. Cooley, Taxation (2d ed.), 678. Hence, power to a nunicipality to levy a tax for watchmen purposes will not authorize a tax on shares of stock. Bank of Georgia v. Savannah, Dudley (Ga.), 180 (1832). Under a statute authorizing it, a city may levy a tax on stock in a lo- cal bank, even though some of the stockholders are non-residents. Union Bank v.

			within tle former stato.&#x0027; This principle of law is based on the fact tlhat shares of stock are personal property; that they are distinct from the corporate property, franchises, and capital stock; that they follow the domicile of their owner like other personal prop- erty, and that consequently be may be taxed therefor wherever he may reside. It accordingly is a question of policy and expediency with a state whether or not it will tax its citizens who are stock- holders in foreign corporations.&#x0027; A few of the states levy such taxes."

			But New York pursues tile more broad nnd libornl policy that shares of stock should not be taxed where the corporation is already taxed; that the state which fuirnishes facilities to the corporation for the earning of dividends should have the sole benolit of taxes on such corporate interests; that a tax on resident stokholdeors in non-resident corporations would generally result in a double tax- ation of stockholders not residing in the state creating the corpo- ration; nnd that interstate comity, interests, and financial invest- monts are promoted best by taxing corporations directly, and not levying a tax on either resident stockholders in non-resident corpo- rations or resident stockholders in resident corporations where the St. 405 (1808). In New Jersey now there is no tax on shares of stock except in banks. See Newark Banking Co. v. Newark, 121 U.

In Texas shares of stock are not taxed where the capital or property of the corporationistaxed. Gillespieo. Gaston, 07 Tex. 599 (1887). California made a wise resolution when. in 1881, it repealed § 3040 of its political code, taxing shares of stock, and added the following (§ 3008) to the code: "Shares of stock in corporations possess no intrinsic value over and above the actual value of the property of the corporation which they stand for and represent, and the assess- ment and taxation of such shares and also of the corporate property would be double taxation. Therefore all property belonging to corporations shall be as- sessed and taxed; but no assessment shall be made of shares of stock, nor shall any holder thereof be taxed there- for." Sustained and applied in Burko v. Badlam, 57 Cal. 594 (1884); Spring Valley Waterworks v. Schottler, 02 Cal. 69, 118 (1882). But the temptation to tax stockholders in non-resident cor- porations was yielded to. See San Fran- cisco v. Fry, 63 CaL 470 (1883); San Francisco v. Flood, 04 Cal. 504 (1884).

			corporation itself is subject to taxation.&#x0027; The injustice of a tax on resident stockholders in foreign corporations is at once apparent when it is considered that the state creating the corporation nearly always taxes the corporation itself or all its stockholders, resident and non-resident; and that if stockholders residing elsewhere are taxed again whore they reside, they are taxed both in the state of the corporation, directly or indirectly, and also directly in the state where they reside. No reduction need be allowed in the latter state for taxes levied upon the corporation in another state.&#x0027;
			§ 506. Tl&#x0027;ax on non-resident stockhotlors in resident or domestio corporation.-- ode7 of collecting.- When it is dltermined by a state that it prefers to levy a tax on shares of stock rather than on the franchises, capital stock, or tangible property of the corporation, or to levy a tax on both, there is no doubt as to its right to tax tle stockholders residing within the state. But more difficulty occurs as to the right of the state to tax non-resident stockholders in cor- porations created by the state. This right has been strenuously denied on the ground that shares of stock are not located at the domicile of the corporation, but follow the domicile of the stock- holder.
			It is the well-established rule, however, that although shares of situs of stock for the purpose of tax- ation may be where the owner of the stock resides. Stanford v. City. etc., 131 Cal. 34 (1900). Stock hold hy residents in foreign corporations may be taxed. Bacon v. Board, etc. Com&#x0027;rs, 126 Mich. 22 (1901).

Bank, 19 Wall. 490, 499 (1873), the court said: "Personal property, in the absence of any law to the contrary, follows the person of the owner, and has its situs at his domicile. But, for tie purpose of taxation, it may be separated from him, and he may be taxed on its account at the place where it is actually located." See also Whitney v. Ragsdale, 83 Ind. 107 (1870); Tallman v. Butler County, 13 Iowa, 531 (1801); Saxton v. McCosh, 12 Iowa, 527 (1801); Mayor, etc. of Bal- timore v Baltimore. etc. Ry., 57 Md. 31 (1881). Cf. Richmond v. Daniel, 14 Gratt. (Va.) 38.5 (1858); also the case of Oliver v. Washington Mills, 93 Mass. 208 (1805), which holds such a tax to be un- constitutional. The common-law&#x0027;rule is well expressed in Union Bank v. State, 9 Yerg. (Tenn.) 490 (1830), where the court said: " The power to tax non- resident stockholders is denied, and we

			think correctly; from its very nature It must be a tax in pcrsonam and not in rein, Stock is in tile natureofaohose in action and can have no locality; it must, therefore, of necessity follow the per- son of the owner. . . . Bank stock is not a thing in itself capable of being taxed on account of its locality, and any tax imposed upon it must be in the nature of a tax upon income, and of neo cessity confined to the person of the owner; and if he be a non-resident, he is beyond the jurisdiction of the state and not subject to her laws."

Bauder, 80 Ohio St. 28 (1880), the court said: " That shares of stock may be separated from the person of the owner by statute, and given a situs of their own, was held In Tappan v. Merchants&#x0027; Nat. Bank, 19 Wall. 490 (1873). But when not so separated, that this situs follows and adheres to the domicile of the owner, is supported by a great weight of authority."

			of this tax may be by compelling the corporation to pay it and giving it a lion theorofor on tile stock, or authorizing it to deduct tile tax fromi tle non-resident stockholders&#x0027; dividends; or, if tio statute is silent as to the mode of collection, a tax warrant or an attachment and execution therefor may be levied on the shares of stock.1 Where tho statute provides that stock shall be taxed and sometimnes by tih shareholders, to avoid this liability. But it is established by repeated adjudiatlions, and ought to be considered definitely settled." And in First Nat. Bank v. Smith, 05 II. 44 (1872), the court said: "The separation of tho situs of personal property fron the domicile of the owner for the pur. poses of taxation is familiar doctrine of the courts of this country, and bas boon sanctioned by this court in vari- ous cases. . . . The act of congress itself contemplates a severance of the situs of such sllres from tile person of their owner by providing that they should not be taxed except in tile state where the bank is established. But, apart from this, it is really much more reasonable to fix the situs of shares at the place where the bank is located, and where it must continue to do its business or wind up its affairs, than to separate by legislation tangible per- sonal property from the person of its owner." In St. Louis Nat. Bank v. Papin, 4 Dill. 20 (1870); s. c, 21 Fed. Cas. 203, the following statute was sus. tained: "The taxes assessed on shares of stock embraced in such list shall be paid by the corporations respectively, and they may recover from the owners of such slares tile amount so paid by them, or deduct the same from the dividends accruing on such shares: and the amount so paid shall be a lien on such shares respectively, and shall be paid before a transfer thereof can be made." And again. in American Coal Co. v. County Com&#x0027;rs, 59 Md. 185 (1882), the court said: "The state may give the shares of stock held by individual stockholders a special cr particular situs for purposes of taxation, and may provide special modes for the collec-
			tion of tle tax levied thereon." But where the statute merely made the bank the agent to pay the tax and to deduct it from the dividends, the bank is not liable if there have boon no divi. dends. IIershiro v. First Nat. Bank, 85 Iowa, 272 (1872). Non-residont stock. holders in Virginia banks are taxed. Stockholders v. Supervisors, 88 Va. 203 (1801). Concerning the situs of stock, see also an article in 45 Alb. L J. 830. 1 In Farrlngton v, Tennessee, 05 U. S. 070, 067 (1877), the court said: "The bank may be required to pay the tax out of its corporate funds or be author- ized to deduct the amount paid for each stockholder out of Ils dividend." And, in general, under the act of con- gress allowing taxation of shares of stock in national banks, a situs is given by statute to the shares so as to locate them where the bank is located, even though the stockholders be non-resi- dent. But collections cannot be en- forced against the corporation unless the statute specially authorizes it. First Nat. Bank v. Fancher, 48 N. Y. 524 (1872). As to collection by execu- tion, see Gordon v. Mayor, etc., 5 Gill (Md.), 231 (1847); Weld tv Bangor, 59 ile. 416 (1871). But a levy of execution on stock can only exist when the stat- ute allows stock to be so taken. Barnes v. Hall. 55 Vt. 420 (1883). See also § 480, s8q)ra. A state may prescribe that resi- dent stockholders shall pay a tax where they reside, and that the corporation shall pay a tax based upon the value of the shares of stock held by non-resi- dents, and that the corporation shall have a lien on the stock of such stock- holders for such tax so paid.

The court held also that a state imay tax sharesof stock hold by non.residents in domestlo corporations, even though the corporation paysataxon all its property. Italso held that although residentstock- holders in a domestic corporation are allowed a deduction of $183 per share - from a market value of $2310 a share of their holdings o.stook, leaving the tax- able value of the stook $47, a similar deduction may be refused to non-resi- dent stockholders, inasmuch as the statute did not provide for such deduc- tion for the latter, and inasmuch as there was no proof that the non-resi- dent stockholders were citizens of the United States. As to levy under a tax warrant, see MoNeal v. Mechanics&#x0027;, etc. Assoc., 40 N. J. Eq. 851 (1885) But if the stockholder pays the tax, even under protest, lie cannot recover back the money paid. Sowles t. Soule, 59 Vt. 131 (1887). In the case of State r. Thomas. 26 N. J. L. 181 (1857), the court refused to compel the corporation to pay the tax on stock of non-residents, and said: "It has been decided by this court that the bonds and stocks of cor- porations in this state held by non- residents are not liable to taxation, though they are clearly within the let- ter of the act." A state may collect a non-resident stockholder&#x0027;s tax from the corporation and give it a lien therefor on his stock. North Ward Nat. Bank v. Newark, 39 N. J. L. 380(1877); but see Raleigh, etc. R R. v. Wake County Com&#x0027;rs, 87 N. C. 414 (1882) A tax col- lector cannot levy on and sell stock under the law relative to attachments.

			thorizo the assessment of tle stock to the bank.&#x0027; Tle Connecticut statute authorizing the taxation of stock hold by non-residonts in resident corporations is constitutional, even though a deduction for real estate helld by the corporation is allowed the resident stockholders, but not to non-resident stockholders.2 In New York, where neither resident nor non-resident stockholders in either foreign or domestio corporations, excepting banking corporations, are taxed on their shares of stock, these interstate complications, hardships, and jealousies do not arise. Trover and case lie against a tax collector for selling stock for an illegal tax.&#x0027;
			§ 5G7. Double taxatio).--The most objectionable feature of a tax levied on shares of stock is that almost inevitably it operates to impose a double tax on a part or all of the stockholders.4 Such a double tax exists where either the corporate realty or personalty or franchise or capital is taxed, and a tax is also levied on the shares of stock witlout any deduction for the former taxation." There has been some controversy as to the right of a state to levy a double tax on property. Sometimes the state constitution pro- hibits such taxation." Thus, in Michigan it is held that the consti- tutional requirement of uniform taxation prevents a tax being levied on stock held by residents in a foreign corporation where the property of the corporation is situated in that state and is taxed I State v. Merchants&#x0027; Bank, 160 Mo. 040 (1901). 2 Traveller&#x0027;s, etc. Co. v. Connecticut, 185 U. S. 864 (1902). &#x0027; Sprague t. Fletcher, 09 Vt. 69 (1800). 4 In Ohio such double taxation is ad- vocated and recommended. In Frazer v. Siebern, 16 Ohio St. 614 (1866), the court said that an equitable system of taxation "is best attained in case of a corporation or joint-stock company by taxing the stockholders, the persons who own the property, upon the full value of their shares therein, including, of course, their interest in the franchise or privilege, and in all tangible property owned by the company; and by taxing the corporation also upon the value of such tangible property. The stock- holder is thus taxed, as all other individ- uals who own tangible and intangible property are sometimes unavoidably taxed, once upon all he is worth, and a second time upon that part of his prop- erty which is tangible."
			óThis is practically the result. In the case of Farrington v. Tennessee, 05 U. S. 679, 687 (1877), however, the court said in a dictum: "The capital stock and the shares may both be taxed, and it is not double taxation." See also New Orleans it Houston, 119 U. S. 265, 277 (188). Cf. Ryan v. Com&#x0027;rs, 80 Kan. 185 (1888). A tax on the tangible prop- erty and on the capital stock is not double taxation. Second Ward Sav. Bank v. Milwaukee, 94 Wis. 687 (1806).
			County Com&#x0027;rs v. Farmers&#x0027; Nat. Bank, 48 Md. 117 (1877), the constitution saying that each person shall pay a tax "according to his actual worth in real or personal property." See also San Francisco v. Mackey, 21 Fed. Rep. 539 (1884); Burke v. Badlam, 57 Cal. 594 (1881), relative to the California consti- tution, art. XII, § 1, that "all property shall be taxed in proportion to its value." 1214 § 607.]

			by it. Such taxation is double taxation., But, aside from consti- tutional restrictions, it unquestionably is within the power of tho state to levy, not only a double tax, but oven a treble or quadruple tax, if it so chooses.2 The injustice of such taxation, however, gen- erally prevents its occurrence. The courts also do their utmost to prevent double taxation, and will construe £t taxation statute so as to avoid such a result, and somotimn s even in opposition to the plain words of the statute itself.&#x0027; IStroh v. City of Detroit, 00 N. W. Rep. 1020 (Miloh. 1002). 2Salem Iron, etc. Co. v. Danvers, 10 Mass. 614 (1813), where corporate realty was taxed although the shares of stock were also taxed. See also Bolo v. For- syth Com&#x0027;rs, 82 N. C. 415 (1880). In the remarkablo case of Toll Bridge Co. v. Osborn, 85 Conn. 7 (1808), It seems that the realty, capital stock, and shares of stock of a corporation were taxed, and that the chief stookholder, a railroad, was taxed on its capital stock and shares of stock, making four or five taxations of the same property. Evi- dently corporations were not popular in Connecticut in 1808, except for taxa- tion purposes. Cf. Jones, etc. Co. v. Com. monwealth, 09 Pa. St. 137 (1871). See also Cook v. Burlington, 59 Iowa, 251 (1882); State v. Branin, 28 N. J. L 484 (1852); State v. Bentley, 23 N. J. L. 82 (1852); Memphis v. Ensley, 6 Baxt. (Tenn.) 553 (1873); Providence, etc. RR P v. Wright, 2 R L 459, 404 (18583 holding that a tax on the stock does not raise a pre- sumption that a municipality is thereby prevented from taxing the corporate realty. See also Hannibal, etc. R. B v. Shacklett, 80 Mo. 550, 500 (1860). Al. though by the charter a tax is levied on the capital stock, a tax may also be levied on the shares of stock. Mem- phis v. Home Ins Co., 91 Tenn. 558 (1892) A tax on the bonds which are issued by a corporation does not consti- tute double taxation although there is also a tax on the franchises of the cor- poration. Commonwealth v. New York, etc. R. R, 150 Pa. St. 234 (1892). Where the stock is not taxable if the tangible
			property is taxed, the stock may never- theless be taxed for Rsuch part of its value as the capital stock exceeds in value the tangible property. Hyland v. Central Iron, etc Co., 120 Ind, 08 (1801). A tax may be levied on the capital stock even though the sharesof stock are also taxed. Durhalll County v. Blaokwell, etc. Co., 110 N. C. 441 (1895). The franchise may be taxed although the shares of stock are also taxed, the latter tax being collected also from the corporation. U. S.

			§ COS. rnlemptions from taxation as affeltitng tax on Asares oj stock,.- An exemption of sharce of stook is a contract protected by that provision of tile constitution of tho United States which pre- vents a state from passing a law which will impair the validity of contracts.&#x0027; This provision has frequently boon construed and applied in cases involving the taxation of the corporate franchises, capital stock, or tangible property. In the numerous decisions on this subject there appear two classes of .tses of exemptions from taxation which affect the taxation of shares of stock. The first class involves the question whether an exemption of the corporate property, franchises, or capital stock from taxation exempts also the shares of stock from any tax; the second, whether an exemp- tion of the shares of stock from taxation exempts the corporate N. J. L. 478 (1857); State v. Tunis, 23 N. J. L. 546 (1852); Smith v. Burloy, n N. IL 423 (18:18); Frazer v. Siebern, 10 Ohio St. 014 (1800): Savings Bank v. Nashua, 46 N. H. 880 (1800), the court saying: "It is a fundamental principle in taxation that the same property shall not be subject to a double tax, payable by the same party,either directly orindirectly; and where it is once decided that any kind or class of property is liable to be taxed under one provision of the stat- utes, it has been held to follow as a legal conclusion that the legislature could not have intended the same prop- erty would be subject to another tax, though there may be general errors in the law which would seem to imply that it was to be taxed a second time." In Michigan, where shares of stock in savings banks are taxed, a reduction being allowed for realty, which is taxed separately. the courts held that no other tax can be levied against the cor- poration. Lebawee, etc. Bank v. Adrian, 66 Mich. 273 (1887). The Ken- tucky tax statutes are so construed- that a corporation need not pay a tax on its property in addition to the tax on the stock. Louisville, etc. Co. v. Bar. hour. 88 Ky. 73 (1888); Commonwealth v. St. Bernard Coal Ca, 9 . W. Rep. 709 (Ky. 1888). The Pennsylvania acts are construed so as to prevent double taxation.

Whorea coal company ownsallthe stock of a railroad company, and taxes have been paid by the railroad on the ap- praised value of itscapital stock, thecoal company cannot be taxed on such stock again. Double taxation is legal, but will not be imposed unless the statute clearly requires it. Commonwealth v. Fall Brook Coal Co.. 150 Pa. St. 488 (1898). In the case of Louisville, etc. R. R. v. Wright, 110 Fed. Rep. 009 (190a, the court held that stock could not be taxed under the Georgia statute, where the corporation paid taxes, even though the statute required taxpayers to make a return of stock owned by them. Where all the property of the corpora- tion is taxed and then a tax is levied on the capital stock, this amounts to a double taxation and will not be upheld unless the statute clearly authorizes such double taxation. Lewiston, etc. Co. v. Asotin County, 24 Wash. 371 (1901).

			property, franohises, and capital stook. As regards the former exemption, tho effect thereof depends largely on the words used in the statute or chartor granting the exemption. Tile question has given rise to a difference of opinions. In tile federal courts, Now Jcrsey, Indiana, and Kentucky, it lias been decided that an exomp. tion of the corporation from taxation on one or more of the first throe methods of taxation exempts by in plication the shares of stook,&#x0027; althlough the supreme conrt of the United States has recently he!d that exemption of the capital stock dloes not necessarily oxempt the stockholders.2 Tn Tennessee, North Carolina, and Maryland, and in fact generally, an exemption is strictly construed.&#x0027; l State v. Branin, 28 N. J. L. 484 (1852); State v. Bentley, 28 N. J, L. 582 (1852); Johnson v. Commonwealth, 7 Dana (ICy.), 888 (1838); King v. Madison, 17 Ind. 48 (1801), holding that an exemp- tion of the capital stool exempts shares of stock. An exemption of the corpo. ration on its property exempts also the shares of stock, and exemption of the shares of stook exempts the corpora- tion. State v. Heppenheoinor, 58 N. J. L. 03 (1890). An exemption from tax- ation of the capital of a corporation exempts the shares of stock. Penrose v. Chaffrix, 100 La. 250(1901). An ex- emption of the capital and personal property of the corporation from tax- ation exempts the shares of .tock. Richardson v. City of St. Albans, 72 Vt. 1 (1809). Gordon v. Appeal Tax Court, 8 How. 183 (1845), held that an exemp- tion prolibiting any "further tax or burden upon them," the banks, ex- empted the shares of stock. Again, where the charter provided that "the capital stock of said company shall be forever exempt from taxation, the shares of stock cannot be taxed . . Each share is a part of the whole, and, as the whole is exempt from taxation, it follows that each part or share must also be exempt." Tennessee v. Whit- worth, 22 Fed. Rep. 75 (1884). And the purchaser and successor of a rail- road, taking by statute all its rights and privileges, is also exempt in the same manner. Tennessee v. Whitworth, 22 Fed. Rep. 81; asf&#x0027;d, 117 U. S. 180

			(1880). An exemption of the corporation exempts it from a tax upon the stock of stockholders, which the company is required to pay irrespective of any dividends or profits payable to the stockholder, since this is substantially a tax on the corporation itself. New Orleans v. Houston, 110 U. S. 205 (1881). Cf. U. S. v. Railroad Co, 17 Wall. 832 (1872). An exemption of shares of stock from taxation is waived by the acceptance of subsequent stat. utes imposing a tax. Hannibal, etc. R R. v. Shacklett, 80 Mo. 550 (1800); Cooley, Taxation (2d ed.), 212.
			New Orleans v. Citizens&#x0027; Bank, 107 U. S. 871 (1897). 3 Union Bank v. State, 0 Yerg. (Tenn.) 490 (1830), holding that an exemption of the capital stock did not exempt shares of stock. To same effect, Mem- phis tv Farrington, 8 Baxt. (Tenn.) 539 (1870), the court saying: "The capital stock and shares of stock are two dis- tinct properties, and an exemption of the one does not thereby necessarily exempt the other, nor the taxation of the latter operate as a tax on the for- mer, so as to interfere with its exemp- tibn from such burdens." A tax may be levied on the shares of stock al- though the capital stock is exempt. State v. Bank of Conlmerce, 95 Tenn. 221 (1895); Belo u Forsyth Com&#x0027;rs, 82 N.

			As regards tho second class of exemptions, it seems to be es- tablished by tho great weight of authority that an oxemption of the shares of stock from taxation exempts also, by implication, the corporato franchises, the capital stock, and tangible property from any tax.&#x0027; Where tho charter conmpels a corporation to pay an an- nual tax on each slare of stoclk "in lieu of all other taxes," tho stockholders themselves cannot be taxed on their stock.2 Such an exemption, however, does not prevent the state from levying a tax Tax Cases, 12 G. &#x0026; J.

			on the capital stock,1 and such an exemption is lost by a judicial sale of the franchises of the company.2 A statute conferring upon a new corporation " all the rights and privileges " of a former cor- poration does not confer such an exemption.3 Nor does such ex- emption continue where the charter is so amended as to chang;o an insurance company into a banking company.4 Nor is such an exemption good where, after the granting of a charter, but before the first organization meeting, a now constitution is adopted by the state forbidding such exemptions." An exemption of stock does not exempt the property of the corporation where the charter pro- vides against such latter exemption.ption Exptions have no effect and are of no avail beyond the boundaries of the state granting them; and accordingly a non-resident stockholder, who is taxed on his stock in the state where he resides, cannot defeat that tax by reason of exemptions enjoyed within the state creating the cor- poration.7
			B. TAXATION OF NATIONAL-BANK STOOK. § 569. General rulcs.--It is one of the established principles of constitutional law in this country that the instruments of govern- ment by the United States shall not be taxed by any state, and also that those of a state shall not be taxed by the United States. Accordingly, bonds issued by the United States government can- not be taxed by any state.8 So, also, when the old United States Bank was in existence, it was held that neither the bank nor its capital stock could be taxed by a state. But it was also held that, inasmuch as the interest of the stockholders in,the bank was dif- ferent from the franchises, property, capital stock, and the United States bonds held by the bank, such interest of the stockholder could be taxed by a state, and that such taxation would be con- stitutional and legal.9 The same rules apply to the present national stock, but not as against holders of old stock.

Y. 102 (1801): a. a, 82 Barb. 509, and declaring uncon- stitutional the New York statutes under which the national banks were taxed. New York has been exceed- ingly unfortunate in its efforts to tax national banks. After the decision in Bank of Commerce a New York City, 2 Black, 020 (1862), came Bank Tax Case, 2 Wall. 200 (1864), declaring un- constitutional the New York statute of April 29, 1803, for the taxation of na- tional banks, the tax still being on the capital stock. Next came Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wdll. 573 (1805) (reversing Utica v. Churchill, 33 N. Y. 101 -1805. See also First Nat. Bank v. Fancher, 48 N. Y. 524-1872), declaring unconstitu- tional the New York statute of March 9, 1805, taxing the stockholders in na- tional banks, because the act did not prescribe expressly that the tax should be no greater than the tax on other shares of stook, and because taxes in New York on other corporations were
			not on shares of stock, but on the cal.- tal stook. Now York then passed the not of April 23, 1800, whic was sus. tained in People v. Corn&#x0027;rs, 4 Wall. .14 (1800). Still later came the case of People v. Weaver, 100 U. S. 080 (1879), reversing 07 N. Y. 510, overruling Peo. ple v. Dolan, 80 N. Y. 59 (1807), and de- claring void the New York tax of na- tional.bank stoolk, for the reason that the New York court of appeals con- strued the Now York taxation statute to allow persons taxed on ordinary se- curities a deduction for debts, while a similar deduction was not allowed to stockholders in banks, state or national. Supervisors v. Stanley, 103 U. S. 805 (1881) [see People v. Dolan, 80 N. Y. 60 -1807], practically modified the pre- ceding case, however, by holding that a stockholder who owed no debts could not complain, and that those who did owe debts were entitled, not to a re- lease from the tax altogether, but only to the extent of what the state ought to have allowed as a deduction. States cannot tax national-bank currency. Home v. Green, 52 Miss. 452 (1870). Cf. Ruffin v.. Orange County Com&#x0027;rs, 69 N. C. 408 (1878); Lilly v. Cumberland County Com&#x0027;rs, 09 N.

			§ 570. Place in which shares of nalional-bank stock may be taxed. The Revised Statutes of the United States expressly declare that non-resident stockholders in a national bank are to be taxed at the place where the bank is located.&#x0027;J Under this statute a non-resident of the state within which the bank is situated can be taxed on his stock only where the bank is located.3 The state where he resides cannot also tax him on such stock.

S. 580, 548 (1870), says that the effect of the act of congress, as regards the taxation of national banks, is that congress says to the states: "You may tax the real estate of the banks as other real estate is taxed, and you may tax the shares of the bank as the personal property of the owner to the same extent you tax other moneyed capital invested in your state. It was conceived that by this qualification of the power of taxation equality would be secured and injus- tice prevented." Wasson v. Indianap- olis Nat.

			[§ na1. § 571. Th6 tax I)lSt not be greater tIhanl that implosed on olther " moneyed capital."--T o most dilllcult, unsettled, and litigated questions connected with the taxation of shares of stook in national banks arise from the meaning and application of that provision of the statutes of the United States requiring that the taxation of na- tional-bank shares of stock shall not be at a higher rate than the taxation of other " moneyed capital " within the state. The term " moneyed capital " as used in the statute authorizing taxation of national-bank stock refers to capital which comes in competition with the business of national banks.&#x0027; The words " moneyed cap- ital " have been construed to mean " not only bonds, stocks, and money loaned, but all credits and eomands of every character in favor of the taxpayer." 2 This has been the subject of much con- troversy, however; and the decisions go very far in upholding the tax, if substantial justice has been done.3 Money invested in rail-

			roads, manufacturing, minining, or mortgages is not " onoyoed cap- ital " competing with national-bank capital, and honce a tax on tho latter nooeed not beo t tho sanme rate as upon tho former.&#x0027; Tho fact tlat by statute general stoocs can be taxed at only tlirty cents on each hundred dollars does not prevent a higher rate on national- bank stock.2
			The method of taxing shares of national-bank stock need not correspond tothat followed in taxing other corporations in tho state.3&#x0027; The material point is that national-banks must not, as a re- sult, be taxed higher than other moneyed investments. If this rule is observed, it is of little consequence whether the tax on national- bank stook is levied and assessed in the sanm way as other corpo- rations are taxed.
			If the state laws allow a deduction to a person taxed on bonds, l Aberdeen Bank v, Chehalis County, 100 U. S 410 (1807). " Moneyed capital means money employed in a business whose object is to make profit by in- vesting such money in securities by way of loan, discount, or otherwise, which from time to time, in the course of business, are reduced again to money and reinvested."

S. 83 (1887) "There is no reason to suppose that congress cared at all about the mode the states might adopt for the collection of their taxes. A tax imposed on the capital or property of a corporation falls as effectually on the capital of the shareholder represented by his shares as does a tax upon the shares directly; and although, in legal discrimination, a tax upon the former is not a tax upon the latter, practically and substantially taxation of the capi- tal of the corporation is taxation of the capital of the shareholder." A tax on national-bank stock was upheld, though all other stock except bank stock was exempt, the tax being on capital stock, in Mercantile Nat. Bank v. New York, 28 Fed. Rep. 770 (1880); asf&#x0027;d, 121 U. S. 138. The mode of collection need not be the same. The state may compel
			the bank to pay the tax. National Bank v. Commonwealth, 0 Wall. 353, 308 (1800), per Miller, J. But if the as- sessment is illegal, ln that no notice and opportunity is given to the stock- holder to appear and resist the tax, it cannot be enforced. Albany City Nat. Bank v. Maher, 0 Fed.

If material, the national- bank-share tax is to lie allowed a simi- lar deduction.

			A refusal to allow a deduction to stockholders in national banlks similar to a deduction allowed on a tax levied on other "moneyed capital" is hlold to be a discrimination in contravention of tho statute. Special exemptions, however, of certain stocks or other forms of "moneyed capital" do not require that a similar exemp- tion should be made on national-bank stock.&#x0027;
			Again, tle national bank oct cannot bo evaded by an unfair as- sessment of the shares in national banks as compared with the as- sessment of other moneyed capital. It is a well-known fact and an understood matter in nearly all localities that no kinds of property are valued at their actual selling worth in making the valuation for taxation purposes. Consequently if other moneyed capital is valued in the assessment rolls at a certain proportion of the actual value, and national-bank stock at a higher proportion, the tax is illegal and cannot be collected.2 &#x0027; Thus, a special contract exemption of a fewstate bonds from taxation will not exempl, thie national bonds Lion. berger v.

Where, however, the assessors assess ordinary securities at three-fifths of their actual value, and assess bank stock at its full actual value, and such method of un-

			TAXATION OF STOOK AND 0ORI&#x0027;ORATIONS. [Oi. XXXIV. § 572. The bank may brinig suit to restrain an illegal tax on its stockh7olders.- There has boon sombO doubt as to whether a national bank could bring suit to restrain an illegal tax on its stockholders. Ordinarily a corporation cannot do so. Each stockholder must protect his own interests. But where, as in the case of national banks, the tax is paid by the bank itself, an( collected by it from its stockholders, if the latter refuse to pay the bank or recognize its payment as legal, many suits would result. Accordingly, in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits, it is now well established that the bank itself may file a bill in equity to prevent ant enjoin the col- lection of an illegal tax on its stockholders.? A suit to declare in- valid a tax levied on national-bank stock must be in equity.2 Tlle New York court of appeals hold, however, that a suit in equity tax on national-bank stock cannot be enforced. If such stock is assessed at two-thirds of its actual value, and other personal property at one-half their value, the assessment is illegal. First Nat. Bank v. Lindsay, 45 Fed. Rep. 019 (1891) IQuoted and approved in Knopf v. First Nat. Bank, 173 Ill. 831 (1898); City Nat. Bank v. Paducah, 2 Flip. 01 (1877); s. c., 5 Fed. Ca. 755, where the court said: "The bank is so far the trusteeof the stockholders and the custodian of the dividends that it is entitled to maintain the bill. It might be sub- jected to great annoyance by stock- holders who denied the legality of the tax, and gave the bank notice that it would pay at the peril of being sued by them. It is certainly no hardship to permit the whole question to be liti- gated in a single action." This case holds also that an injunction against the collection of the illegal tax will be granted. In general. see also Albany City Nat. Bank v. Maher, 20 Blatchf. 841 (1882); North Ward Nat. Bank v. Newark, 40 N. J. L. 558 (1878). Cf. Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108 (1870); Tappan v.

Colonan, 41 Hun, 344 (1880). The same rule does not apply to a cor- poration wlhich brings suit to prevent the levy upon and sale of a non-resi- dent stockholder&#x0027;s stocks for non-pay- ment of his tax. Waseca Co. Bank v. McKIenna, 82 linn. 468 (1884). The case of Farmers&#x0027; Nat. Bank v. Cook, 32 N. J. L 347 (1867), denies the right of the bank to bring the action, and says: "The corporation is not the agent of the stockholders for any such purpose." A national bank may file a bill to re- strain the imposition of a tax on stock, the bank having to pay the tax. But the injunction against collection of the tax is granted only as to the excess of tax. Whitney Nat. Bank v. Parker, 41 Fed. Rep. 402 (1890). The bank cannot file a bill in the federal court unless the tax involved is over $2.000. Sioux Falls Nat. Bank v. Swenson, 48 Fed. Rep. 621 (1892).

			Where a company is really located in a city and does all its busi- ness there, but its articles of incorporation state its principal place of busincss as being in an adjacent town, tie sole object being to evale taxation, the court will hold that for taxation purposes its principal place of business is in such city.6 Where the capital stock I Mercantile, etc. Bank v.

Where, subse- quently to the incorporation of a com- pany, a general act reserves to the leg- islature the right to amend or repeal any and all charters, the legislature may repeal any amendments to the charter, so far as such amendments are passed after the general act, where the amendments do not expressly waive the legislative right of amendment or repeal, unless the amendment is worded "saving, whenever that power was ex- erted, all rights previously vested." An exemption from taxation may be re- pealed under the reserve power. (Ap- proving Tomlinson v. Jessup. 15 Wall. 454-1872, and Railroad Co. v. Maine, 96l U. S. 499 -1877.)

			Where a consolidation is cl&#x0027;ccted after the adoption of constitu- tional provisions prohibiting the legislature from exempting tho property of corporations froin taxation, tile consolidated company is looked upon as a new corporation, which is not entitled to ox- emptions from taxation possessed by tle companies of which it is composed.3 Consolidation, berng a dissolution of the old compa- nies, destroys an exeomltion of one of theln from taxation.4 timber lands.

			If the franchises and property of a corporation be transferred by a sale in foreclosuro, an exemption from taxation does not ao- company the transfer. The exemption is a personal privilege and not a franchise.&#x0027; A statute exempting the property of a corpora- tion from being taxed does not prevent the taxation of land hold by it merely for convenience and not necessary to its operation.2 Whero a corporation owns property in excess of an amount speci- sied and limited by the charter, an exemption from taxation does U. S. 801 (1804), reviewing the cases on this subject of dissolution, and holding that the presumption is always against the dissolution. Where, in consolldat- ing, now certilicates of stook are issued, a now board of directors elooted, and thl constituent companies cease their functions, the old companies are thereby dissolved and a new company is formed, even though the name of the new company is the same as one of the old companies.

The New York tax upon the business of all foreign and domestic corporations doing business in the state is a tax on the right to be a corporation and to do business, and is not a tax upon the fran- chise, even though the tax is measured by the dividends declared. The tax is legal although the corporation owns United States bonds. Home Ins Co. v. New York, 134 U. S. 594 (1800).

This is not interfering with interstate coin- nerce by levying a tax for tle privilege of transacting such com- nerce.7 A state through.which a railroad runs may require, upon the consolidation of the company with companies in other states so as to make an interstate railroad, the payment of a tax on the whole consolidated capital stock."

			stitutional as regards a foreign railroad corporation which olns a railroad in the state, such railroad being part of an interstate system of railroads.&#x0027; But a state may levy a tax on the capital stock of a foreign sleeping-car company, which runs its oars through the state, the tax being on such part of the capital stock as the number of miles which its oars run in the state bears to the whole nulmber of miles which its cars run in all the states.2
			A tax on interstate telegraph messages is unconstitutional.&#x0027; But a state may tax a foreign telegraph company engaged in interstate tolographl business, the tax being graded according to the amount and value of the company&#x0027;s property in the state measured by miles, and the tax being in place of taxes levied directly on the property. Such a tax is a franchise tax.4 A city, under authority of a statute, may compel an interstate telegraph company to pay an annual license of $500 for the privilege of doing business in such city. This is a tax, and is not a condition or restriction on the privilege of doing business in the state.5 A state cannot prohibit the agents of foreign express companies from doing business in the state, except upon obtaining a license. Such a law is an interference with interstate commerce.° A tax may be levied, based on the gross receipts, and, if the road is but partly in the state, on a pro- portion of the gross receipts determined by a mode prescribed by statute.7 A state may tax a railroad on business that passes out of the state into another state and back into the first state again.8 Various other decisions on taxation in its bearings upon interstate commerce are given in the notes below.9 1 Norfolk, etc. R R. v.

A similar decision was made concerning a tax on the capital stock of a foreign telegraph company, the capital stock being valued at the aggre- gate value of ail itsshares of stock, and the proportion of its lines within the state to those outside of it being the basis of taxation.

			§ 572o. Inlieritanloo tax.- During the past fifteen years the vari- ous states of the Union, in their eager search for now modes of taxation, in order to moot the lavish expenditures of state and mu- nicipal govornments, have found a rich source of income in an in- heritance tax, levied upon the wealth of the dead. Indeed, so fruit- ful and easy is this mode of taxation, it is being adopted throughout the Union and will soon become almost universal. Pennsylvania led the way some sixty years ago.1 Tho Pennsylvania inheritance state commerce. State v. Woodruff, eto Co., 114 Ind. 155 (1888).

			and their customers § 573. Pleading and practice in actions relative to stock.-When an owner of stock who is out of possession brings an action for its recovery, or for the recovery of the certificate, or for damages for the detention or conversion of either the stock or the certificate, it is important to determine what action will lie, in what court the action is to be prosecuted, and what is the measure of damages. Similar questions arise when suits are brought for breach of con- tract to subscribe for stock, or of contracts to sell and convey stock. There are certain well-settled rules as to the form of action in these cases which are deduced from the older common-law pleading and practice. These rules, even in the code states, where the old ac- tions have been abolished in name, are still partially applicable. Some knowledge, therefore, of the procedure at common law in stock cases is necessary.1
			§ 574. Assumlpsit.-An action of assumpsit, or indebitatus as- sumpsit at common law, lies against a corporation for unjustly refus- ing to register a transfer, or for refusing to issue a certificate to one entitled to. it.2 So, also, assumpsit lies for breach of contract to

			§ 575. Trespass on the case.-An action of trespass on the case may be brought against the corporation for a denial to a stock- holder of a certificate of stock,6 and an action on the case lies for a conversion of shares of stock.7 The appropriate remedy of a pur- chaser against a corporation for refusal to register a transfer to himself is an action on the case, wherein the measure of damages a corporation for refusal to register a transfer of stock.

But even thero, for the convor. sion of a oertillcate of stock, trevor will lie.2 For the maintonance of the action of trover there must be title in the plaintitf to the subject of the action, and an actual conversion by tle defendant. If either of these elements is wanting the action will not lie. Thus, trover will not lie for the conversion of a ccttilicato where the title to tle shares is divested.3
			And, upon tie other hand, withholding possession of a certili- cato of stock cannot amount to a conversion of the stock itself so long as the certificate is not indorsed; but it may amount to a technical conversion of the certilicate.4 A transfer of a certificate rity will render a refusal to deliver the and replevin, damages being recovered pledged property a tortious conversion in trovor, the very articles in detinue of it.

			of stock in the usual sorn may constitute a transfer of the right to bring suit for the conversion of such stock.&#x0027; It is well established that a refusal of a corporation to register a transfer in the name of one entitled to the stock is a conversion of the slarea.&#x0027; In lew York a transferee nay try his right to registry in an action for dividends,&#x0027; but not after commencing an action for conversion." Wllere the corporation has been held liable for conversion, it can- not then tender tho stock back to the stockholder and avoid the payment of the damages.&#x0027; A failure or refusal by the corporation to issue a certificate to an original subscriber, when by the terms of the contract of subscription it ought to be issued, may be treated as a conversion." So, also, in certain cases, a failure to deliver stock according to a contract for delivery,7 or to return borrowed stock Cal. 010 (1875). For an example of an insuilcient complaint in trovor for shares, in that there was no sufficient averment of a conversion or of facts from which a conversion might be in- ferred, see Edwards v. Sonoma Valley Bank, 59 Cal. 180 (1881); and see also Cumnnock v. Newburyport Say. Inst., 142 Mass. 342 (1880). IMahaney v. Walsh, 10 N. Y. App. Div. 601 (1897). 2 Allen v.

Trover lies against a corporation at the in- stance of a purchaser of certificates of stock for refusal to transfer the stock on the books of the company. Ralston v. Bank of California, 112 Cal. 208 (1800). But see New London Nat. Bank v. Lake Shore, etc. Ry., 21 Ohio St. 221, 232 (1871). The corporation may interplead in certain cases See § 387, supra. In suing for damages for conversion against the corporation for depriving a person of his stock, the latter need not tender the certificates. Carpenter v. American Bldg. etc. Assoc., 54 Minn. 403 (1803). Where the transferee of certificates of stock in a bank presents
			them to tho cashier of the bank for transfer, and the cashier and a director delay transfer until a debt of the trans- ferrer to the bank becomes due, and then in behalf of the bank levy an at- tachment on the stock for such debt, the transferee may hold the bank and the cashier and such director liable in trover for conversion of the stock, and it is no defense that the transfer of the certificate was made to defraud credit- ors. Hine v. Commercial Bank, etc., 110 Mich. 448 (1800). Where the pur- chaser of a certificate of stock sends it to the corporation for transfer, and the secretary&#x0027;replies that the.corporation has a lien on the stock, the corporation is not liable for a conversion of the stock, no demana for the return of the certificate being shown.

			on demand, or at the time when by ngreooeont it ought to be re- turned,t and an unautlorized sale of stock by a pledgee in viola- tion of the terms of the contract of bailment,&#x0027; or by a broker in violation of his contraet,3 are examples of conversion of stock. In Oregon it is said that any interference subversive of the right of the owner of stock to enjoy and control it is a conversion.4 Trovor will not lie by a trustee, on stock which stands in the name of the ceqtui qyu trast, against a person taking title from a co-trustee. A suit in equity is the proper remedy.? Where a certificate of stock is supposed to be burned, but is afterwards found, a conversion for refusal to deliver dates from the time when it is found." Proof of demand is necessary in order to support the action of trover, where the defendant came into lawful possession of the stook and had an interest in it.7 A settlement between a principal and his agent is no bar to a subsequent suit by the principal against the agent for certificate was not transferred. MHaha. noy v. Walsh, 10 N. Y. App. Div. 001 (1897). A person entitled to stock on a contract cannot maintain trover for failure to deliver. Reid &#x0027;. Caldwell, 40 S. E.

Where a person loans stock to another to borrow money upon, con- version does not lie for a failure to re- turn the stock. Barroweliffe v. Cum- mins, 00 Hun, 1 (1892). Where bonds are loaned to use temporarily upon an agreement to return them when called for, and the member of the firm to whom they are delivered uses them for his own purposes, he converts them. Birdsall v. Davenport, 43 Hun, 532 (1887). Where a stockholder in an in- solvent corporation turns over his stock to another person to deposit under a reorganization agreement, the latter agreeing to pay the assessment on the stock and to deliver to the stockholder the new securities upon repayment of such assessment, and he refuses so to do thereafter, he is guilty of a conver- sion and of a fraud upon the stock- holder.

Anillegalsale of the pledge by pledgee is a conversion, and a complaint for such conversion will not be construed as a complaint for breach of contract. Smith v. Hall, 07 N. Y. 48 (1870), distinguishing Austin v. Raw- don, 44 N. Y. 03 (1870) For refusal of pledgee to return property, the action of pledgor may be in tort or contract. International Bank v. Monteath, 89 N.

			against a pledgee disposing of stock owned by a certain party, or an attachment upon the interest of that party, does not prevent the pledgee selling the stock if such stock really belonged to the wife of that party.&#x0027; A stockholder whose stock llas been wrong- fully pledged may enjoin the corporation from allowing a transfer by the pledgee who has applied for the same, and the plodgor need not allege that the pledgee took with notice. It is for the pledgee to intervene and prove that the pledge was bona Jlde.2 A court will enjoin a party from voting upon or disposing of his stock in a corporation pelndetle lte where the plaintiffs show that they trans. ferred the stock to the defendant on the latter&#x0027;s agreement not to sell the same, except with the consent of the formor, and lhat when lie did sell the stock three-fourths of the proceeds should belong to the former, and it appearing further that the defendant had given the stock to his sister witlholt consideration.3 A bill in equity is the proper remedy to obtain possession of certificates of stock.&#x0027; A tion of the injunction is a bar to dam- ages upon a dissolution of it. The pre- liminary injunction, being an equitable remedy, is not granted if only legal relief is sought by the action. See Mc- Ienry v. Jewett, 90 N. Y. 58 (1882). A principal who is suing an agent to ob- tain shares of stock may enjoin the agent from transferring the same pen- dente lite. Chedworth v. Edwards, 8 Ves. Jr. 40 (1802). Where a proposed consolidation is attacked by a stock- holder, a preliminary injunction, granted so as not to render useless the whole suit in case it is successful, will not be disturbed by the court of ap- peals. Young v. Rondout, etc. Co., 129 N. Y. 57 (1891). Where a stockholder has delivered his stock to the directors to be divided into smaller certificates, and the directors claim that it was agreed that a part of the stock should be sold for the benefit of the corpora- tion, the stockholder may have a pre- liminary injunction against such sale pending his suit to compel delivery of the stock. Bedford v. American, etc. Ca, 51 N. Y. App. Div. 537 (1900). A stockholder cannot prevent other stock- holders from selling their stock on the ground that the purchaser may man- age the company to the detriment of
			minority stookholders; and the fact that the plaintiff&#x0027;s stock was on deposit with the trust company and that he cannot get the stock and thus accept the order to purchase his stock also, is no ground for an injunction. Ingraham v. National Salt Co., 72 N. Y. App. Div. 582 (1902). A corporation by the action of its board of directors and consent of all its stockholders may agree that a certain percentage of its profits shall be paid annually to a person for serv- ices already rendered by him. In a suit by him to enforce such agreement and asking an injunction against any sales of stock, except with notice of such agreement, stockholders are neces- sary parties defendant. Such an agree- ment is not an exclusion of future boards of directors from the manage. ment of the company. Dupignac v. Bernstrom, 70 N. Y. App. Div. 105 (1002), 1 Fourth Nat. Bank, etc. v. Crescent, etc. Co., 52 S. W. Rep. 1021 (Tenn. 1897). 2Reynolds v. Touzalin Imp. Co., 02 Neb. 280 (1901ˆ 3Weston t. Goldstein, 89 N. Y.

			§ 5S0. Plteading nttlder the codes.-- In general, a ploeading under tile code is not a safe pleading, unless it conforms substantially to the rules of pleading at common law. Some vorbiago may be omitted, but the relief granted by the various common-law actions cannot be obtained even under tile code without the necessary averments entitling the plaintiff to that relief. It is the allegation of the facts, and not the method of alleging them, that constitutes a sufficient pleading under the code.&#x0027;
			§ 581. The ilcasrre of damages - (a) The first rilo-Value how showt wOhen th1&#x0027;re is no inarket value.- Great difficulty has been experienced in determining what shall be the measure of damages for the conversion of stock. As the manner and conditions of the 1 Bracken v. Atlantic T. Co., 107 N. Y. 510 (1001). Where stock is tied up by an injunction which is afterwards va- cated, and in the meantime the stock depreciates in value, the loss can be re- covered from the enjoining party if the stocks could and would have been sold before the depreciation if they had not been so tied up. But if such stocks are in pledge, and the pledgor does not pay the loan while the stocks are so tied up, no damages can be recovered. Fourth Nat. Bank, etc. v. Crescent, etc. Co., 52 S. W. Rep. 1021 (Tenn. 1897). See also g 388, supra. 2 Burrall v. Bushwick IR R., 75 N. Y. 211 (1878). f. Tockerson v. Chapin, 52 N. Y. Super. Ct. 10 (1885).

McAllister, 1 Utah, 273 (1875),
			it is held that the language used in the pleadings in these actions is not ma- terial, or that the language is that of one form of action or another, or of no form, but that the question is wlhether the facts entitle the plaintiff to recover. A declaration in an action for the wrongful conversion of the shares of the capital stock of a corporation is suffi- cient for the purposes of pleading if it states the ultimate facts to be proven. The circumstances which tend to prove those facts may be used for thle purpose of evidence, but they have no place in the pleadings. McAllister v. Kuhn, 96 U. S, 87 (1877), affirming Kuln v. McAllister, 1 Utah, 273 (1875). As to a misjoinder of causes of ac- tion under the California code, where the plaintiff sues to recover certain stock, see Johnson v. Kirby, 65 Cal. 482 (1884).

In doterminiig the value of stook which hlas no market value, the actual value of the assets of the corpo- ration is considered, but not the good. will, where the company never did a profitable business. Even though the assets are subsequently sold, yet, if the sale was a forced sale, the price realized is not admissible to prove such actual value. Feige v. Burt, 124 Mich. 505 (1900). In estimating the value of stock under an. inheritance tax statute, the earning capacity, good-will and income of the corporation may be considered. Matter of Brandretl, 28 Misc. Rep. 408 (1800). Where the stock has no market value, the value of the property of the corporation in excess of its debts is ad- missible. McDonald v. Danahy, 100 II. 183 (1002). The value of stock may be ascertained by comparing the corporate assets with the liabilities. Nelson v. First Nat. Bank, 09 Fed. Rep. 708 (1895) The value of stock may be shown " by proof of the value of the property and business of the corporation, its good- will and dividend-earning capacity." State v.

Where stock has no market value its actual value may be shown, and proof may be given of the value of the corporate assets and divi- dends paid, and the character and permanency of the business, and the control of the stock, and other circum- stances. A sale of a single share of stock which carries the control does not fix the market value, but a sale two years prior may be shlown. If there is no evidence the par value is presumed to be the actual value. Moffitt v. Here- ford, 132 Mo. 513 (1800). The value of the stock for four years afterwards, without a showing as to the relative condition of the company on the two dates, is not admissible. Jones v. Ellis, 68 Vt. 544 (1800).

See also Me- Guffey v. Hunes, 85 Tenn. 20(1880). The value of stock may be shown by show- ing the value of the property of the corporation, the amount of capital stock, and the amount of debts.

Rep. 007 (1001), the court, in speaking about the unre- liability of quotations of stock as a basis for its intrinsic value, said (p. 012): "The court knows by experience and observation that railroad properties when sold as an entirety, almost with- out exception. yield nothing to the stockholder, although the stock may have been sold in share lots upon the stock exchange for years previously at advanced figures. The court knows also, from observation, that these stock quotations are frequently advanced by contending interests for control, or by short interests in the market, such as ran the Northern Pacific within a year to quotations almost tenfold its real value. The court also knows from ob- servation that the speculative public, dealing in stock sales, and making its quotations, are governed largely by the prospect of present dividends, and not by any general conception of permanent earning capacity. These, and other considerations that could be mentioned, make stock quotations an indicia, but an unstable indicia, of the real value of the capital stock as an en- tirety." 2 Blair Co. v. Rose, 20 Ind. App. 487 (1001).
			So whon stoock held as collateral is improperly sold by the pledgee, the value on the day when the pledgor pays lis debt and demands his stock is to be taken. Fisher v. Brown, 101 Mass. 250 (1870). In Fremoian tv Harwood, 49 Me. 105 (18.0), shares of stock standing in the name of the defendant as collateral security for a debt which had been paid wore sold for non-payment of an assessment and bought by defendant. It was held that the defendant was liable in trover for the value of the shares at the time of the&#x0027; sale, with in- terest, and all dividends received tllereon,detlucting theanount of the as. sessment and the expenses of the sale. In Sturges v. Keith, 57 111. 451 (1870, it is held that where the demand and re- fusal constitute the conversion, or afford presumptive evidence of it, the date of sucl demand and refusal is the proper time for estimating the value. Again, where the corporation wrong- fully refuses to register a transfer and to issue a certificate, the measure of damages is the value of the stock on the day when the transfer was demanded and refused.

			Where the pledgee of stock wrongfully sells it, tho injured party may recover the highest market price between the time of notice of sale and a reasonable time within which he might have bought the stock elsewhere.&#x0027; In a suit against a corporation for refusal to transfer stock on its books, " the rule of damages is the highest in- termnedinto value of the stock between the time of conversion and a reasonable time after the owner has received notice of the con- the question of the measure of damages not having been pressed at tho arga. ilont. the court will not reduce the verdict. So also where thero is a fail- ure to return borrowed stock on de- mand, or according to tih terms of the bailmlont, the value on the day of do- nmand, or on the day when the stock ought by contract to have been re. turned, is the measure of damages.

Upon a failure to deliver stock accord- ing to contract or on demand, the value at the time of the demand is the value to be taken. Noonan v. Ilsley, 17 Wis. 314 (1863); Pinkerion v.

For an illegal sale the pledgor may re- cover the "highest price which his stock reached within a reasonable time after its illegal sale by defendants." Smith v. Savin, 141 N.

			version to enable him to replace tile stock."T A bondholder who has agreed to sell his bonds to a reorganize)r in exchange for now bonds and stock may sue for the value of tle new bonds and stock if the rcorganizer refuses to perform, and the measure of damages is the highest value of the now bonds for a reasonable time after the breach of contract.&#x0027;
			Tile New York court of appeals, after many variations, has set- tled on the rule that " in the absence of special circumstances, in an action for conversion of personal property as well as one for failure to deliver it in performance of a contract, where considera- tion has boon received, the value of the property at the time of such conversion or default, with interest, is the measure of compensa- tion." &#x0027; Where directors have issued stock to themselves at a price less than the market price, they may be held liable at the instance of a stockholder suing for the benefit of the corporation, for tle difference between the price they paid and the price of the stock when it was issued to them. The highest market price since that day for small amounts of stock is no basis for the measure of damn- ages.4
			§ 582. (b) The second &#x0027;rule.- In another line of cases the true measure of damages in these actions is said to be the value of tile stock on the day of the trial.&#x0027; In an English case it is said that this is a sound rule in the ordinary cases of conversion of stock, but that in cases of failure to deliver stock the true measure of damages is the value when the demand is made and refused." This second rule has found little favor, and there is believed to be no sound reason for its adoption.
			§ 583. (c) The third rlle.- It has been held in still another class. of decisions that the measure of damages for the conversion of stock is the highest market value of the stock between the date of 1 And a general allegation of damage is sufficient, inasmuch as the plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages any- way.

The measure of damages may be the price at which the defendant sold the securities, if already sold, and, if not sold, then the amount of depreciation in value since plaintiff demanded them, together with inter- vening dividends.

			the conversion and tleo day of the trial. This is tho rule in Cali- fornia in sone cases.&#x0027; So, also, in South Carolina,&#x0027; Georgia;&#x0027; and it was formerly tlo rule in Now York and Pennsylvania.&#x0027; The courts of the two latter states have, however, in later cases wholly receded from this position; and in both tile rule is now established, in such actions, that the Ineasuro of damages is not the highest price of tle stock, but tile vlue at the date of the conversion." Where &#x0027; Cal. Codo, § 8330, is as follows: " Tle dutrimlnt caused by the wrongful con. version of personal property is pre- suimed to be: 1. The value of tle prop- ertyat the time of the conversion, with the interest from that time; or, wheoro the action has been prosecuted with reasonable diligence, the highest mar- ket value of the property at any time between the conversion and the ver- dict, without interest, at the option of the injured party." This is held to apply to the conversion of the shares of stock. Fromm at Sierra Nevada, etc. Co., 01 Cal. 002 (1882); Dent v. Hol- brook, 54 Cal. 145 (1880). Cf. Thompson v. Toland, 48 Cal. 99 (1874). The courts have held that this section of the code applies to the conversion of shares of stock, but they have not worked out a very consistent rule on the subject. In Douglass v. Kraft, 0 Cal. 502 (1807), the "highest value" rule is adopted, but in later cases the court seems to incline toward the modern New York rule. Hamer v.

			§ 584. Interest, dividends, and special damlages.- It is settled law that, in addition to the value of the stock at thl date of conversion, tho plaintilnmay recover legal interest upon such valuation from the dato of the conversion to tho (lay of the trial. It follows as of course that, if the plaintiff has been damaged in an ascertained sum, he may, in an action for damages, recover not only that sum, but interest thereon in the meantime.2 There are also authorities (1874); Harris v. Tumbridge, 88 N. Y. 02 (1880); Colt v. Owens, 00 N. Y. 868 (1882); Randall v. Albany City Nat. Bank, 1 N. Y. St. Rep. 502 (1883). Cf. Suydam v. Jenkins, 8 Sands. (N. Y.) 011 (1850); Matthews v.

It is now held in Pennsyl. vania that where a corporation, through innocent mistake, permits a transfer on its books of shares of stock under a forged power of attorney, the owner&#x0027;s measure of damages is the value of the stock at the time of the transfer, with interest from the date of the verdict, and not the highest price reached by the stock between the date of the con- version and the time of bringing suit. with the dividends since declared.

			to the effect that in addition to interest the plaintiff may recover also all dividends paid upon the stock between the date of the con. version and the day of the trial; &#x0027; but, aside from unusual oases, the rule would seem to be a lharsh one, except in those jurisdictions where the measure of damages is tle value at the time of the trial. The better rule is that the plaintiff may also recover any special ldamages which he has sustained by reason of the detention of 1s stock.&#x0027;
			§ 585. Nominal damages.-In certain cases, whore tho plaintiff has been guilty of Inches, or where the stock is of no actual value, or where the stock could, for a reasonable time after the conver- sion, have boon purchased in the market for the same or a lowoer price, or in any other case where the plaintiff has suffered only a technical conversion without any actual pecuniary loss, only nom- inal damages can be recovered.3 Thus, the measure of damages for 1804).

Boston, etc. R. v. Richardson, 185 Mass. 473, 477 (1883). Where a broker, a gratuitous bailee of corporate stock, delivers the same to the company without author ity, and the stock is converted to the use of the company, the bailee is liable for its value, irrespective of what his intentions were in the premises. In such case the bailor may recover the value of the stock at the time of con- version, with all dividends paid from the time of delivery, together with in- terest on the value of the stock from date of conversion, and on the divi- dends from date of respective pay- ments. Hubbell v. Blandy, 87 Mich. 209 (1891). Where several years elapse be- tween the commencement of the suit and the trial, the case not having been prosecuted with reasonable diligence, the value at the time of the conversion, with interest, is the measure of dam- ages. Dividends are not to be added unless a separate demand for them is
			alleged and a separate cause of action therefor set forth. Ralston v. Bank of California, 112 Cal. 208 (1800). In an action for the conversion of stock the measure of damages is the highest in- termediate value between the time of conversion and a reasonable time after the owner las received notice of the conversion to enable him to replace the stock. Dividends accruing after the conversion are not added, nor interest on such dividends. Citizens&#x0027;, etc. IL R. v. Robbins, 144 Ind. 071 (1800). 2 Boylan v. Huguet, 8 Nev. 345 (1873); 2 Sedgwick, Damages (7th ed.),891; Bod- ley v. Reynolds, 8 Q. B. 779 (1840); Davis v. Oswell, 7 Car. &#x0026; P. 804 (1837). C: Seymour v. Ives, 46 Conn. 109 (1878). 3Thus, where a borrower of shares fails to return them until after the cor- poration is dissolved, the lender having made no demand during the existence of the company, the measure of dam- ages. in an action to recover the shares. will be the market value of them at the time the cause of action accrued: that is, at the time of demand. And if at that time the stock is worthless, only nominal damages are recoverable. Fosdick v. Greene, 27 Ohio St 484 (1875). See Cameron v. Durkheim, 55 N. Y. 425 (1874); Hope v.

			(1800). In an action for damages for fraud inducing the plaintiff to pur- chase stock, the measure of damages is " not the difference between the con- tract price and the reasonable market value if the property had been as rep. resented to be, even if the stock had been worth the price paid for it; nor, if the stock were worthless, could the plaintiff have recovered the value it would have had if the property had been equal to the representations. What the plaintiff might have gained is not the question, but what he had lost by being deceived into the pur- chase." The defendant "was bound to mlake good the loss sustained, such as the moneys the plaintiff had paid out and interest, and any other outlay legitimately attributable to defenldant&#x0027;s fraudulent conduct; but this liability did not include the expected fruits of an unrealized speculation." Smith t. Bolles, 132 U. S. 125 (1889). The true measure of the damages suffered by one who is fraudulently induced to make a contract of sale, purchase. or exchange of property is the difference between the sctual value of that wvhich he parts with and the actual value of that which he receives under the contract.

As to the measure of damages in an action against a broker for fraud inducing the plaintiff to invest in " Grantand Ward " securities, seeJanmes v. Worl, 70 IIun, 200 (180). The measure of damages in an action by a vendee for fraud in the sale of stook is the dif- ference between the selling price and the real value at the time of the sale. High :r Berret, 148 Pa. St. 201 (1S02). Where, in an action by a vendee of stock for fraud in inducing purciase, the jury find that the stock had no value what- ever and render a verdict for the pur- chase price, it is immaterial that the court erred in regard to the measure of damages. Honsucle A. Ruflin. 172 lass. 420 (1800). The vendee may bring an action for damages for deceit even where le has paid part of the price and given security for the balance. He may recover damages to the extent only that the representations were false. Weaver v. Shriver, 70 Md. 530 (1804). If a director misrepresents the financial condition of the company and thus in- duces a stockholder to sell his stock to him, he is liable tothe vendor for the dif- ference between the actual value of the stockand thepricepaid. Humev.Steele, 9 S. W. Rep. 812 (Tex. 1900). The meas- ure of damages is the difference be- tween the actual value of the stock and the value it would have had if the repre- sentations as to the financial condition
			of the company had been true Drake v. IIolbrook, 00 S. W. Rep. t12 (Ky. 1002). And where one with intent to clieat and defraud induces another, by false and fraudulent representations, to pur- chase shares for value which he knows to be worthless, he is liable for the dam- ages sustained, whether the purchase was maloe from him or from another at his instance, Hubbell v. Meigs, 50 N. Y. 480 (1872); 28 N. Y. App. Dlv. 1 (1808). See 88 L. T. Rep. 431.

Where there is no market value for stock the measure of damages in an action for deceit, causing a party to purchase the stock, is the difference between the value of the stock and its value if the corporation had had the amount of property represented, that being the subject of the misrepresenta- tion. Boddy v. Henry, 118 Iowa, 40C (1901) In a suit by a purchaserof stock to hold the directors liable for a false annual report which caused him to pur- chase, the measure of damages is the difference between the value of the stock as it is and as it would have been had the annual report been true. Par- eons v. Johnson, 28 N. Y. App. Div. 1 (188). The measure of damages for fraud in the sale of stock is the differ- ence between the real value of the stock at the time of sale and what the value would have been had the repre- sentations been true.

A person who puroliases bank stool from the bank itself may hold the bank liablo for damages, whore the public state- ment of the bank which le relied on in purohasing was false. The measure of damages is the difference between the value of the stock if the statement had been true and its actual value. Ex- olange Bank v. Gaitskill, 817 . W. Rep. 100 (Ky. 1890). In an action for dam- ages for deceit inducing the plaintiff to purchase stock, the measure of dara- ages is "a sum of money equal to the difference between the value of the property as itwas in fact and the value
			12i
			as it would have been if the represen. tations had been true." In this kind of action no tender of the stock is neces- saryor proper. Testimony as to thevalue of the property of the corporation and of a sale of stock by a witness is admissible. Vail v. Reynolds, 118 N. Y. 297 (1890). Where one has been induced by fraud- ulent misrepresentations to buy or sub. soribe for shares of stock, the measure of damages, in an action against the vendor, is the differenco between the value of the stock as represented and the actual value.

They elect the directors, control the general policy through them, and within the charter limits may prolong or dissolve the corporate existence at their pleasure. All these vital powers of the stockholders can be exercised by them only in corporate meetings, duly convened and properly organized for the transaction of busi- ness. Accordingly, the method of calling together a corporate meeting, the time and place of that meeting, the notice to be given to the stockholders, and the various incidents relative to a proper convening of the members of the corporation, are of great impor- tance. They constitute the subject of this chapter.
			§ 589. The place of meeting of stoc;kholders vust be wvithin the state creating the co;rloration.- The first and most general rule as to the place where stockholders may hold corporate meetings is that the place of meeting should be within the boundaries of the state which created the corporation, although through its agents, of course, the corporation may make contracts, carry on business, sue and be sued, and buy and sell property in another state.&#x0027;
			There is a difference of opinion as to the effect of business trans- acted at a stockholders&#x0027; meeting held beyond the borders of the state creating the corporation. Upon the one hand, it is held that all the acts and proceedings of such a meeting are wholly invalid

			and void; that the corporation is not bound thereby, and that tho moeting is as though it had never boon hold.&#x0027;
			But it is tho sounder view to regard the votes and proceedings at such it meeting as voidable rather than void. Tho corporation itself cannot allege that such proceedings are void.

Vermont Copper Min. Co., 40 N. Y. Super. Ct. 400 (1870); asf&#x0027;d, 07 N. Y. 280; Smith v. Silver Valley Mlin. Co., 04 Md. 85 (1885), the organization being held out of the state; Camp v. Byrne, 41 Mo. 525 (1807), to the same effect. Stock- holders cannot legally meet out of the state. Harding v. American, etc. Co., 182 111. 551 (1809). In Copp r. Lamb, 12 3Me. 812 (1835), thirty years&#x0027; user was held to have cured any defect. A Vir- ginia corporation cannot be organized by an organization meeting in New York. Nor can the charter be assigned by a blank assignment after an organi- zation in Virginia. The assignment must be of the stock. The corporation is neither de facto nor de jure. Suits against it fail. Welch v Old Domin- ion, etc. Ry., 10 N. Y. Supp. 174 (1800).
			Stookholders&#x0027; meetings hold out of the state are voidable if not void, and at the instance of minority stockholders may bo good ground for an Injunction. Jones v. Pearl llin. Co., 20 Colo. 417 (1804). Where a charter is takenl out in one state and the organization meet- Ings are hold In another state, the pro- sunmption Is that no corporntion is or- ganized; and unless proof is given that the statutes of the first-naned state au- thorized the holdingof the organization mooting in another state, the stock- holders are liable as partners. Duke t. Taylor, 87 Fla. 04 (1800). Where par- ties take out a charter in Tennessee, but, instead of holding their organiza- tion meetings in Tennessee, hold them in Florida, where they do all their busi- ness, they are liable in Florida as part- nera Taylor v. Branham, 85 Fla. 297 (1895). The dicta in this decision as to the liability of stockholders generally in foreign corporations doing business in Florida are startling, to say the least. 2 Heath v. Silverthorn, etc. Co., 89 Wis. 140 (1875), holding that the corpo- ration may be estopped to deny the va- lidity of acts done outside the state, when the rights of third parties inter- vene, even though that meeting was the organization meeting. Thelegisla- ture may validate the acts passed at such a meeting. (raham v. Boston, etc. R. R., 118 U. S. 101, 170 (1880) aff&#x0027;g a c., 14 Fed. Rep. 753 (1883). Cf. GKenada County v.

			Whore several persons, their associates and successors, are do- clared to be a corporation, one of thor with now parties may meet, organize, andl adopt by-laws, without the capital being first sub- scribed and without the others if they do not object.3 As to an ovcr-subscription for stock, the rules that govern the subject are considered elsewhere.4 The survivors of those who by special act are made a corporation may call the first meeting many years after the act was passed, and may open books for subscription to I Lochimoro Bank v. Boynton, 05 Mass. 800 (1858); Hughes v. Parker, 20 N. I. 58 (1840). Seo also p. 525, supra. The grant of corporate powers to one per- son and his associates and successors does not require of such person that he should take associates before the act can take effect or corporate powers be exercised, but confers upon him alone the powers of the corporation, ,ud his acts within the grant of such powers become the acts of the corpora- tion. Penobscot Boom Corp. v. Lamson, 10 Me. 224 (1830). Where a special char- ter named the incorporators and com- missioners, and the notice called for by the charter of the opening of the books of subscription was given, and all in- corporators attended the meeting and verbally subscribed for stock, and gave checks to apply on the same, and a meeting of the stockholders was held and directors elected, and the directors held their meeting and elected officers, and annual meetings were held there- after for five years, when the company was practically abandoned, and the checks were never used,- all this amounted to a legal organization of the corporation. Moreover, the corporation existed by the charter itself, without action on the part of the incorporators. A company thus organized may enjoin
			from exercising its franchises a subse- quent attempted organization of the company made sixteen years thereafter, the subsequent organization having been made by part only of the Incorpo- rators. The incorporators cease to have any powers after the first organization meeting, The remedy may be in equity, and need not be in quo wcarranto. Union Water Co. v. Kean, 52 N. 1. Eq. 111 (1803). Where the incorporators named in a special charter organize by subscribing one share each and allow- ing another person to subscribe for the remainder, he at the same time en- tering into a personal contract with them that he would construct the street railway called for by the charter within a certain time. and for failure so to do he was to " return the charter," a suit by the original incorporators to cancel his subscription and to obtain control of the board of directors will not lie, inasmuch as the contract was an attempt to transfer the corporate franchise.

Directors&#x0027; lleetij//s.- The various questions connected with directors&#x0027; meetings, the place where such meetings may bo held, the notice that is required, the question of whether tlh direct. ors may act without mooting, and the requirements as to a quorum, are discussed elsewhere.3 Where a statute provides that the char- tor may be amended in certain respects upon the directors or a majority of themn making and signing a certificate, such making and signing need not be at a meeting of the directors.

In Jolnston v. Jones, 23 N. J. Eq. 216 (1872), the charter provided for annual
			elections, but no by-laws had been made fixing the time. The authority to call an election being in the direct- ors, it was held not sufficient for a ma- jority of these to sign the notice with- out stating that it was given by order of the board, and without designating themselves as directors.

Although the charter prescribes that the commissioners who receive the subscriptions shall call the first meet- ing by publishing a notice, yet this call may be waived, and the stockholders may meet and organize without a call, if all assent. Judah v. American, etc. Co., 4 Ind. 333 (1853); Chamberlain v. Painesville, etc. R. I., 15 Ohio St. 225 (1864), where the statute provided that, as soon as ten per cent. on the capital
			stock should be subscribed, the persons namied in the certificate of incorpora- tion, or any three of them. might give notice of an election of directors It was held simply directory, and not in- dispensable to an election, that the no- tice be so given. In Newcomb v. Reed, 94 Mass. 302 (1800), the court declared the purpose of such statutes,to be to avoid such difficulty as would arise where two parties should attempt to organize separately under the same charter. It was tilere held that per- sons elected ollicers at a meeting held in variance with such statutory direc- tion were directors nevertheless, and were subject to the statutory liability for corporate debts Where three per- sons are appointed to make a call, and one of them calls the meeting of incor- poration, the other two maling no ob- jection, the organization of the com- pany at the meeting so called is valid.

			Where the statute requires duo notice to bo given, it need not be given by any particular person nor in any particular form.2 A llarter provision or by-law authorizing the calling of a meeting in a certain way does not necessarily prevent the noeeting being called in a different way, but unless waived the rule is otherwise, where the charter or by-law is peremptory.3 The president and cashier of a bank have no autlority to call a stockholders&#x0027; meeting, where the charter provides that stockholders&#x0027; meetings may be called by the board of directors or any three stockholders.4 The olicers or agents of a corporation whose duty it is to call meetings may, in case they neglect or refuse to issue the call, be compelled by man- damut to call a meeting at the instance of a stockholder who is in- jured by reason of their failure."

			If thoro is any fraud in tho calling of tho meeting, the proceed. ings of tho meeting may be attacked in the courts. The fraud may consist in concealing tho notice,&#x0027; or in changing tho time of tho meeting,2 or in misstating tle business.3 A court of equity may restrain the directors from fixing the time for an annual meeting at a date when many members are in the country, the purpose being to prevent them from exorcising their right to vote.4
			§ 5914. WVleon the stoockolders aro entitled to notice of corlporato mectiKl/s.- If the time and place at which a corporate meeting is to be hold and the business to be transacted are distinctly fixed in the charter or by a by-law, this is of itself suficint notice to all tho stockholders, and no further call or notice of that meeting is neces- sary, unless tile charter or by-laws require it.5 But an annual moot- that, where there is no officer compe- tent to call a meoting, thore is no way of convening except by reorganization of the company or a published notice given under the statutes All tie stock- holders, of course, could convene and thereby waive notice. See § 590, infra. The proper olncer may be commanded by mandamus to send out notices of the annual election. People v. Hart, 11 N. Y. Supp. 70, 073 (1890). Mandamus lies to compel a meeting of vestrymen. People v. Winans, 9 N. Y. Supp. 249 (1800). Where those who have the right to call a meeting of the shareholders refuse to exercise that right, for the ex- press purpose of preventing the share. holders from duly assembling, the court will, if necessary, interfere to protect the sharelolders against an abuse of power on the part of those intrusted with the management of the affairs of the company.

Jackson v. Munster Bank, 13 L. R Ir. 118 (1884). 4Cannon t. Trask, L. . 20 Eq. 669 (1875).

			§ 50O. The essential iclments of a notice of a mvcetin are time, ptlace, anll bltsin.ss.--The contents of the notice depend upon the character of tlhe meeting. There are three matters concerning every corporate meeting of which the members are entitled to no- tice, namely: til time, the place, and the business proposed to be transacted. Some or all of these may be known to him by virtue of a charter provision or a by-law or a statute. But if any one of thom is not known in that way, the stockholders are entitled to an actual notice thereof. Accordingly, it is the rule that, in the absence of other valid notice, the call must specify the time and place of meeting and the business to be considered. Although the time of a meeting is fixed by charter, nevertheless the meeting may be hold at a subsequent time and be valid.2 The precise hour at which the meeting is to be held must be stated in the notice.3
			In general, the notice need not specify the business to be consid- ered where the meeting is one prescribed by charter, or where the business is prescribed by charter or statute or by-law, and no other business is to be transacted.&#x0027; But if the meeting is to be held at a time not provided by the charter, the call must specify particularly the time and also the business;&#x0027; and the better rule is that, where &#x0026; C. 426 (1825), where an ancient cus- meeting need not specify that the offi- tom of calling a meeting for an election cers are to be elected, even though the of burgesses by ringing a bell was held by-laws require the notice to state the not to be sufficient notice. business; Warner v.

			unusual business is to bo transacted, oven at a regular mooting, the notice of that meeting should state the unusual business.&#x0027; Thus, at a meeting called to alter tho by-laws and transact other busi- ness, an oloction cannot lawfully bo hold.l Nor can an assossment be leviel at a special meeting when the stockholders were not duly notified that that matter would como up for consideration., A notice of a meeting to increase stock need not specify what the monl law all notices of meetings for Hpecial or exceptlonal purposes wore required to stato the object of the call.

Cleveland, etc. R. I, 23 How. 881. 400 (1859), holding that, though the notice was Insufficient, yet one who was represented by proxy cannot object, especially where he de- Iayed a long time in complaining. A notice of a meeting of a benevolent so jiety called to dissolve must state the object of the meeting. St. Mary&#x0027;s, etc. Assoc. v. Lynch, 04 N. H. 218 (1880). A resolution passed at an extraordinary meeting, upon a matter for the consid- eration of which it was not avowedly called, or which was not specified in the notice convening the meeting, is altogether inoperative.

Notice of a meeting to consider the giving of a mortgage is sufficient to enable the meeting to authorize a mortgage. Evans nt Boston Heating Co., 157 Mass 37 (1802). One and the same meeting may be both ordinary iand extraordinary; ordinary for the
			purpose of transacting the usual busi ness of tie compiny, and extraordinary for the transaction of soime particilar business of whiclh special notice may have been given. See Cutbill v. King. dom, 1 Exch. 404 (1847); Graham v. Van Diemnen&#x0027;s Land Ca, 1 H. &#x0026; N. i41 (1850). IAn annual meeting of tho stocl- holders has no power to change the by- laws, increasing the numberof directors whrero nonotice of such proposed change was given, the chango itself being of vital importance and outside of the usual business transacted at an annual meeting. Bagley v. Reno, etc. Co., 201 Pa. St. 78 (1002), citing tle above text. The annual meeting cannot vote an increase of the capital stock unless special notice of that business has been given, even though the by-laws provide that any business may be transacted at the annual meeting witlhout special notice; the statute, however, prescrib- ing that an increase of capital stock may be at "any meeting called for the purpose." Jones v. Concord, etc. . R., 07 N. H. 234 (1802). By custom any business may be transacted at the annual meeting without special notice thereof being given, but any specific restriction as to any particular business modifies such rule. Mutual F.

Thoro is only an invalidity pro tanto.4

A notice that in case cer- tain things happen a meeting will be held is not good. It is conditional and not absolute. Alexander v. Simpson, L. R 48 Ch. D. 139 (1880). Where one company buys out another, the former may agree to pay a certain sum to the directors and secretary of the latter "as compensation for loss of office."
			This agreement is legal if the stock- holders of the selling company ratify the same. The notice of a meeting of the stockholders, however, to ratify such an agreement must specify such payment, in addition to stating that the object of the meeting is to ratify the agreement generally. A circular subsequently sent to the stockholders referring to the payment to the direct- ors and secretary is not sufficient, even though it was sent before the meeting was held. Kaye v. Croydon, etc. Co., [1808] 1 Ch. 358. A resolution relative to directors&#x0027; pay passed at a special stockholders&#x0027; meeting may differ from the resolution specified in the notice of the meeting; but if the meeting ad- journs and such resolution is confirmed at the adjourned neeting, it must not differ from the resolution as first passed.

Robinson, 80 Hun, 200 (1883), it is hold that notice need not be given to a member of a board of school trustees, the board being a body corporate who is absent from the state and cannot attend the meeting, and that a failure to notify such a member will not render the proceedings at the meeting irregular or invalid. Members of English joint-stock companies resid- ing abroad are not entitled to any no- tice of corporate meetings. Re Union Hill Silver Co., 22 L. T. Rep. 400 (1870) 6 Freeman&#x0027;s Nat. Bank v.

			§ 057. 3Notice mlust be served a reasonable time beforo the neot- ilg.-Thlo notico must bo served upon the stokholdeolrs at such time as is prescribed by tho statutes or if tlh statutes are silent; by the by-laws, or if both are silent on tho subject a reasonable timo before tho day of thoe nooting.1
			§ 598. &#x0027;to divisioln of ltmetings into ordiniar/ and extraordinary. Corporate meetings of stockholders are frequently divided, both by the judlgs and tlhe text-writers, into two Classes - tho first being special or extraordinary, and tile second being ordinary, regular, stated, or general. By reason of this attempt at classifi. cation much confusion has boon introduced into the law without any oorresponding advantage. The terms employed to distinguish tho various kinds of meetings are used in different senses by different writers, so that it is diflicult to define them in such a way as to avoid confusion.2
			§ 599. Waiver of notice.- A stockholder may expressly or by his acts waive his right to have a notice of a corporate meeting duly served upon hi.ll. For instance, an admission at a stock- the notice of the election at a deferred day, wlhich is published in accordance with the charter, is concealed from the lending stookholder, the court will set the election aside. Johnston v. Jones, 23 N. J. Eq. 210 (187). 1 Re Long Island R. R., 10 Wend. 07 (1837). See also Covert v. Rogers, 38 Mich. 303 (1878), where a similar rule is declared as to notice to directors of their meetings. The legislature cannot unreasonably shorten the tinme of the next meeting. Cassell v. Lexington, etc. Co., 9 S. W. Rep. 502 and 701 (Iy. 1888). A reorganization under the English statute will not be sustained as against American stockholders, where the entire business of the Eng- lish company is to own and work American mines, and tle by-laws of the company provide for a longer no- tice than is specified in the English statute. The notice of the meeting to reorganize not having reached the American stockholders in time to at. tend the meeting, the American courts will not sustain the reorganization. Brown v. Republican, etc. Mines, 55 Fed. Rep. 7 (1803). Where by statute it is provided that thirty days&#x0027; notice shall
			be given of certain corporate meetings, that length of time may apply to notices of other meetings of the same corpora. tion. Sholby R R. v. Louisville, etc. R. t., 12 Bush (Ky.), 02 (1870). 2 For instance, in England, all meet- ings of stockholders are called "gen- eral" meetings, and are either "ordi- nary"(i. ., regular)or "extraordinary" (i. c., special. In England the sanm meeting may be both ordinary and ex- traordinary. See Lindley on Compa. nies, pp. 425, 420 (Oth ed.). 3 The acts of a meeting are valid, though held without notice, if all arc present or subsequently ratify and ap- prove of the action. Stutz v. Handley, 41 Fed. Rep. 531 (1890); affirmed as to this point, but reversed as to others, in Handley v. Stutz, 130 U. . 417 (1891). A party accepting the benefit of a con- tract for a long time cannot repudiate it on the ground that the calls for the meetings of the executive committee and of the stockholders which author- ized the contract were insufficient; nor can he set up in such a case that the directors had not authorized the contract.

			holders&#x0027; meeting of tho validity of a claim against the company is valid, oven though the meeting was not called in accordance with the statutes, it not appearing that any stockholder has over ob- jectcd.&#x0027; Although a stockholder is present at a meeting at which an increase in capital stock is voted, yet he may object thereto on the ground that special notice was not given that tho question of the increase would be voted on at tlat meeting, inasmuch as if such notice had been given other stockholders might have at- tended and changed the result.2 But the court will refuse to set aside an election wloro ovory share of stock was represented at the election, even though the minority refuse to vote on the ground that the meeting had been called on less than ten days&#x0027; notice, re- quired by tho statute.3
			Dilliculty as to waivers has been encountered whore by statute or by charter the notice must be published or must be given a specified length of time before the meeting is held. This question arises often in regard to the first and organization mooting of the company, or in regard to a meeting to increase the capital stock, or to issue bonds, or to give a mortgage, or to effect a consolida- tion. The rule, however, is now well established that such statu- tory notice is for the benefit of the stockholders themselves, and, if they waive it, the meeting and all the proceedings are as valid as they would be had the full statutory notice been given.4 stockholder who takes part in a meet. ing cannot afterwards object that it was not properly called. Weinburgh v. Union, etc. Co., 65 N. J. Eq. 0.10 (1897). Objections to the regularity of the notice which was given are waived if all are present at the meeting and do not object to such irregularity. Stebbins v. Mlerritt, 64 Mass 27 (1852); Richardson v. Vermont, etc., 44 Vt. 018 (1872), holding that objections to the proceedings of a meeting called by a notice which did not state what its object was, had been waived by a ratification at a later meeting; Jones v. Milton, etc. Turnp., 7 Ind. 517 (1850). where the stockholders not notified ap- peared and voted by proxy; Kenton Furnace Co. v. McAlpin, 5 Fed. Rep. 737 (1880). See also § 000, infra. Where several persons, their associates and buccessors, are declared to be a corpo- ration, one of them with new parties may meet, organize, adopt by-laws, etc.
			without the capital being first sub- scribed and without the others, if they do not object. lcGinty v. Athol, etc. Co., 155 lass. 183 (182). Notice may be waived. People v. Twaddell, 18 Hun, 427 (1870); 54 Atl. Rep. 254. 1 Clark v. Warwick, etc. Co., 174 Mass. 434 (1800) 2 Jones v. Concord, etc. R. R., 07 N. H. 110 (1801); asf&#x0027;d, 07 N. H. 284(1892).

L. 357 (1899). 4 A constitutional and statutory re- quirement that bonded debt shall only be incurred, when voted at a meeting called on sixty days&#x0027; notice, does not prevent a waiver of such notice by all the stockholders either by express wniver or by attendance without such notice. Riesterer v. Horton, etc. Co., 160 Mo. 141 (1001). A provision that notice must be given to stockholders thirty days before they vote in favor of a mortgage may be waived by them, 283

Althlough tile statutes of Montana require that a mortgage may be given only after a stockhold- ers&#x0027; meeting convened by publication of notice, etc., lins voted it, yet all the stockholders, by voting therefor, waive the required notice, and no one can complain. The mortgage is valid. Campbell v. Argenta, etc. Co., 51 Fed. Rep. 1 (1802). Although the constitu- tion provides that there shall be sixty days&#x0027; notice of the meeting to author- ize the issue of bonds, yet where all tile stockholders assemble and authorize the issue without any notice, and the bonds pass into bonaflde hands, they may be enforced: The absence of a nominal stockholder whoso stock is really owned by one of those present is immaterial.

			§ 002. Scope of the siubjeci.- The business which the stockhold- ers of a corporation in meeting assembled have the power to trans- act is not extensive, but it is of great importance. They elect the (lirectors, pass upon amendments to the charter, deotormino whether any increase of the capital stock shall be made, make the by-laws, andl dissolve or continue the corporation. Those constitute the ohier fulctions of aI stockholders&#x0027; meeting. They are extraordinary in their charactor, and although they are exeox ised at long intervals &#x0027;re ol vital importance. This chapter treats of the business which mIny be transacted at stockholders&#x0027; meetings and of the methods of its transaction.
			§ 003. lElcotions are to bo by the stockholdeors, and may bo com- yelled by imandalmus.-- At common law the directors of a corpora- tion are to be elected by the stockholders in corporate meeting as- sembled.&#x0027; Generally this is declared to be the law by charter or statutory provisions. A contract and by-law giving a voting power to bondholders at corporate elections is void as against public pol- icy and the statutes, where the statutes proscribe that the direct- ors shall be elected by the stockholders and shall not be elected in any other manner.2 In most corporations the president, and also the vice-president, secretary, treasurer, and agents of the corpora- tion, are elected or appointed, not by the stockholders, but by the directors. All these matters, however, are generally regulated by the charter or a statute.
			At common law mandamus lies to compel an election of corpo- rate officers.&#x0027;
			All corporations for profit have power to elect a board of direct- ors.&#x0027;
			The legislature may amend the charter so as to increase the num. 1 It has been held that stockholders cannot fill vacancies in the board of directors at a special meeting, when elections can only be at annual meet- ings. Moses v. Tompkins, 84 Aln. 013 (1887) The soundness, however. of this decision may well be doubtple The by- laws imay and generally do give this power to the diroe;tor&#x0026; And see dictumn in let Union Ins.

State v.

			Where no time is specified by law during which the polls must be kept open, it rests within the sound discretion of the inspectors to say when the polls shall close.8 So also it is hold that holding the polls open after the hour specified in the notice for them to close will not, where the inspectors exercise a reasonable discre- tion, invalidate an election."

			The question has arisen whether a meeting can be hold and busi- ness transacted wheln a majority in interest of the stockholders are not present.

			Two important limitations and exceptions to the above principles are to bo borne carefully in mind.
			First, the majority cannot bind tho minority to submit to an net by the corporation where such act is beyond the express and im- plied powers of the corporation as given to it by its charter. Such an act is ultra vires. A large amount of litigation has arisen from the attempt of the majority to carry out &#x0027;.ltrva virce acts. The mi- nority may object, and even a single :tockholder may have the iltrac v&#x0027;ires act enjoined or set aside.&#x0027; Tile failure of a stockholder to attend the stockholders&#x0027; mecting is not a waiver of his right to object to the acts of the meeting as iltra vires, even though the notice of the meeting stated what was to be done.2
			The second exception arises where the legislature amends the charter of the corporation, and the majority or the stockholders attempt to accept that amendment and act upon it. In such a case, if the amendment materially changes the scope and purpose of the enterprise, the minority may object and may prevent the accept- ance of &#x0027;he amendment.&#x0027;
			The question of how far the majority rule when that majority are interested in a contract which the corporation has made, and which is being passed upon by a stockholders&#x0027; meeting, is consid- ered elsewhere.4
			§ 008. The majority of votes cast constitutes an election.-It is the well-settled rule in corporations having a capital stock divided into shares that a majority of the votes cast at an election constitutes any election.6 And this majority, moreover, need not be an actual numerical majority of all the votes represented at the meeting, but only a majority of the votes cast.0 Accordingly, a majority of the votes cast will elect, even though a majority of the shares of stock are not voted at all, and even though the owners are present at the meeting and refuse to vote.&#x0027; 1 This subject is fully treated in Part IV, infra. 2 McFadden v.

			§ Coo. Is evcry s7hre ofstoc7k entitled to one vote -At common law, in public or municipal corporations, each qualified elector has ono voto, and only one. This was a natural rile, since oaclh d(ly- qualified citizen voted as a citizen and not as the holder of stock. But the samo rule should not apply to private corporations. Stock- holders are interested not equally, but in proportion to the number of shares heol by themn. Naturally and reasonably Lˆ11 share should be entitled to one vote. It has been held, however, that at common law each stockholder had but one voto, irrespective of the inumber of shares hold by him.&#x0027; Where the statutes are silent on the subject, a by-law may give to each sharehollde one vote for each share up to ten; and may fix the proportion of votes which he may cast in excess of that number.2
			Generally the charter or statutes prescribe tlat each share of stock shall be entitled to one vote.3 And a statutory or charter provision to this effect applies not only to elections, but also to all. other questions that may come before the stockholders&#x0027; meetings.4 An election to be held by a "majority of stockholders" means a majority in interest.?

			§ OO9a. CumulatiOv rotlin.--In the constitutions of several of the states there are provisions for enabling a minority in interest of the stockholders to elect a minority of the directors. This is effected by what is known as a system of cumulative voting. By it each stockholder is entitled to as many votes for directors as equal the number of shares he owns multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. Thus, if there are six directors to be elected, a stockholder who owns one hundred shares may poll si. hundred votes, and these votes he may give entirely to one or two or more of the six candidates, as he may see fit. In this way any minority of the stockholders owning one-sixth of the stock, acting together, may elect one member of a board of six directors, and thus secure a representation in that body. A larger minority might secure the election of two members of such a board, the pos- sibility of increasing the minority representation increasing as the minority increases, without it ever becoming possible for a minority, upon a full vote, to secure more than its equitable proportion of the whole board of directors. The larger the number of directors the smaller would be the minority which would be able to elect one member of the board; and the larger the minority the greater the representation possible to be secured.2 Constitutional or statu- tory provisions which are designue to secure such a minority rep- resentation are found in California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, West Virginia, Missouri, Nebraska, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota.3 These 1 Re Moore, etc. o., 14Q.

			provisions, if designed to bo retroactive, have boon held unconsti- tutional and void. They can only apply to corporations chartered after their enactment. So far as they concern corporations char- tered beforo the adoption of such a constitutional provision they impair the obligation of the contract between the corporation, tho stockholders, and tho state, and( infringe the vested rights of tbo stockholders.&#x0027; But, under its reserved power to alter, amend, or repeal a charter the legislature may allow cumulative voting.2 A to be elected " does not authorize ou- mulativo voting. State v. Stockly, 415 Ollio St. 804 (1887). Tle Ohio statute of 1898 provides for cumulative voting. Soilwartz v. State, 01 Ohio St. 407 (1000). Where cumulative voting prevails, and the statutes require three directors to be residents, and all the votes are cu- mulated on non-rosidents excepting thirty-two which are cast for three residents, the three residents are elected, and the remaining directors are those of the non-residents&#x0027;who re- ceived the highest number of votes. Horton v. Wilder, 48 Kan. 222 (1802). In Wright v. Central Cal. etc. Co., 07 Cal. 532 (1885), the court said that this provision conferred "upon the individ. ual stockholder, entitled to vote at an election, the right to cast all the votes which his stock represents, multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, for a single candidate, should he think proper to do so, . . . or by distributing them, upon the same prin- ciple, among as many candidates for directors as he shall think fit." The court held also that this constitutional right as to voting could not be changed by a resolution of the directors 1State v. Greer, 78 Mo. 188 (1883); Hays v. Commonwealth. 82 Pa. St. 518 (1870); Baker&#x0027;s Appeal, 109 Pa. St. 401 (1885). See also, on this subject, ch. XXVIII, supra. Upon the question of the constitutionality of statutes pro- viding for minority representation or cumulative voting in the election of public officers, a matter germane to the present subject, see People v. Kenney, 90 N. Y. 294 (1884); People v. Crissey, 91
			N. Y. 010 (1883); State v. Constantine, 43 Olio St. 437 (1884). In Loowenthal v. llubber Reclaiming Co., 52 N. J. Eq. 440 (1894), the court held that the orig. inal by-laws constituted a contract be- tween the stockholders, and that a by-law providing for cumulativo voting could not be repealed. In Michigan it has been decided that a statute provid- ing for the cumulative plan of voting at public elections is unconstitutional. Maynard v. Board, etc., 84 iich. 228 (1800). 2 Under the reserved right of the leg- islature to alter or amend a charter, the legislature may pass a statute allowing stockholders to cumulate their votes in elections, thus enabling minority stock- holders to elect a minority of the board of directors. Looker v. Maynard, 179 U. S. 40 (1900). Whereby statute the state retains power to amend charters subsequently granted, a subsequent constitutional provision for cumulative voting applies to all such corporations, whether organized by special charter or under the general act, and does not impair the validity of a contract. So also where a corporation amends its charter under an act providing for cumulative voting, such cumulative voting applies to it. Gregg-v. Granby, etc. Co., 104 Mo. 610 (1901). The legisla- ture has no power to amend the charter so as to allow cumulative voting, even though in the original charter the leg- islature reserved the right to alter, amend, or repeal. Such reserved right is only for matters which concern the public. In re Election Newark Assoc., e.c., 04 N. J. L 217 (1899); Attorney- 1U03 Oil. XXXVII.]

Cross v. West Virginia, etc. Ry., 35 W. Va. 174 (1801) 1 Smith v. Atchison, etc. R. I-, 04 Fed. Rep. 272 (1804); Commonwealth v. But- terworth, 100 Pa. St. 55(18)4). Cf. Gregg v. Granby, etc. Co., 104 MIo. 010 (1001), as to a constitutional change. A corpora- tion organized prior to the constitu- tion of 1874 of Pennsylvania, which gave the right of cumulative voting, becomes subject to such right if it.after- wards asks for and acquires new fran- chises. Commonwealth vt Flannery, 52 Atl. Rep. 129 (Pa. 1902). 2 Thus, suppose there are 1,000 shares, and ten directors to be elected, and one person holds 600 shares. Clearly he should be able to elect a majority of the ten directors. Suppose le votes his 600 votes for six of his friends (A, B. C, D, E, and F) and for four of the mi- nority (G, I, I, and J); and suppose at the same time tlie 400 shares of the minority are cumulated on three other parties (K, L, and 31), with ten votes for the four directors mentioned above (G, H, I, and J). The result will then be as follows:
			A, B, C, D, E, and F, have 000 votes each O,It I, andJ " 010 " " K, L, and M " 1,20 " " In other words, the minority have se-
			cured a majority of the directors. Again, suppose the holder of the 000 shares does not vote for any minority candi- date at all, but casts 000 votes for each of his six candidates, A, B. C, D, E, and F. Even then lie may lose the election. The minority 400 may cumulate their 4,000 votes on six candidates, and give each of the six 0005 votes. Under the cumulative system the majority, in order to be safe, must not only abandon the idea of electing the whole board. but must cumulate their voles on such&#x0027; a proportion of the board as their stock bears to the whole stock, and must not cast complimentary votes for repre- sentatives of the minority. In the case of Schwartz tv State, 01 Ohio St. 497 (1000), a majority of the stock was voted in favor of a full board consisting of nine members. The minority cumu. lated their votes on five other candi- dates, thus giving each of those five more votes than any of the nine for whom the majority voted. The result was that the five were elected, thus giving to the minority the control of the board, by reason of the failure of the majority to cumulate their votes 3 Dulin v. Pacific, etc. Co., 103 Cal. 357 (1894). The court said that the party "liad in his own hands enough stock to lave elected himself and one other director, in the face of any combina- tion that could have been made: and the court had no power to release him from his error, or do that for him which lie had power to db for himself."

			§ 010. I&#x0027;roxio.- At commlon law a stockhollor has no right to cast his vote by proxy.&#x0027; This rule was evolved from the analogous rule governing municipal corporations, vwhich requires all votes to be given in person. The right to vote by proxy is often given by the charter itself. Even if not so given the right may be created by by-law.4 Whore the statutes give the right to vote by proxy, the by-laws of the corporation cannot restrict that right by provid- ing that only stockholders shall act as proxies.&#x0027;
			The ordinary proxy, being intended to be for an election merely, does not enable the proxy to vote to dissolve the corporation or to sell the entire corporate business and property, or to vote upon other important business, unless the proxy itself in general or spe- cial terms gives the pioxy the power to vote on such questions.6 I Tucker v.

Whoro a will directs that of throo executors two shall give prox- ies to the third on stock owned by the estate, a court of dquity will compel the two to give tie proxies, although the third intends to use the proxy to continue himsolf as president, and tile manage- ment of the company is alleged to be improvident and ruinous.1 Where theoro are several executors, and only one of them is present at the election, lie may cast the vote, oven though a proxy has been given by another of til executors.2
			A proxy should be in writing, but it need not bo in any partic- ular forim; it need not be acknowledged or proved, but it must be in such a slape as reasonably to satisfy tile inspectors of election of its genuineness and validity.3 And to this end the corporate of- ficers may insist upon reasonable evidence of the regularity and genuineness of the proxy before allowing it to bo votedol The proxy should be dated, but the comimon law did not require a date.

			IELEOTIONS- 0Osl&#x0027;OQPIRATE MEETINGS.
			[Oil. xxXVlI. In Now Jersey, by statute, proxies are good for only throe years from their date;&#x0027; and in New York for only eleven months from their late, unless soine other dlfinite time is specified.&#x0027;
			Where cortillicates of proxies are destroyed after use, parol ovi- donce is admissible to prove their former existence and sufllcioncy.&#x0027;
			A stockholder who signs a form of proxy in blank, and hands it over to another to be used in tle ordinary way, impliedly author- izes that other to fill up the blank with his own name.4 Although a proxy contains blanks as to tile day and hour of the meeting, yet these lmay be filled in by the party using the proxy.&#x0027;
			A proxy is always revocable. Even when by its terms it is made "irrevocable," the law allows tile stockholder to revoke it. Frequently an attempt is made to permanently unite the voting power of several stockholders and thus control the corporation by givinfr irrevocable proxies to specified persons. But the law allows the stockholder to revoke the proxy at any time.G Where the gen- 1 Laws 1890, cll. 185, § 30. 2 Laws 1892, clh. 087, 21. 3 Htywood &#x0026; Pittsborough P. IR Co. V. Bryan, 0 Jones, L (N. C.) 82 (1858). Although the record does not show that certain stock was voted, yet it nmy be proved that it was voted by proxy. Franklin T. Co . Rutherford, etc. Co., 57 N. .. Eq. 42 (1808). 4 Ex parte Duce, L. I. 13 Ch. D. 420 (1879); Ex parte Lancaster, L. R 5 Ch. D. 911 (1877). As to whether a blank &#x0027;proxy may be filled in by the agent, see qucere in White v. New York, etc. Soc., 45 Hun, 580 11887), citing cases.
			Ernest v. Lona, etc. Mines, [1890] 2 Ch. 572.: asf&#x0027;d, [1897] 1 Ch. 1. "Sclhmidt v. Mitchell, 101 Ky. 570 (1897): Woodruff r. Dubuque, etc. R.L, 30 Fed. Rep. 01 (1887). In this case the stock certificates were turned over to trustees to transfer to themselves, with power to vote, hold, or sell the same. "Trust" certificates were issued. The court held that at any time previous to an actual sale by the trustees a certiti- cate holder might revoke his interest in the "trust" and demand back his part of the stock. To same effectand on very similar facts, see Griffith v. Jewett, 15 Week. L Bull. 419 (1886); Vanderbilt v. Bennett, 0 Pa. Co. Ct Rep. 193 (1887).
			Such irrevocable proxies are not neces- sarily void as against public policy. Brown v Paciflo Mlail Steamship Co., 5 Blatchf. 025 (1807); s. c., 4 Fed. Caa 420. They simply are revocable. A proxy given for a valuable consideration may nevertheless be revoked if it is about to be used for a fraudulent purpose. Reed v. Bank of Newburgh, 0 Paige, 337 (1837). An agreement not to revoke a powei which from its nature or by law is revocable is not binding. People v. Nasi, 111 N. Y. 310, 315 (1888). A writ- ten contract not to vote by proxy, entered into by certain stockholders mutually for the purpose of preventing the board of directors from consum- mating a proposed sale of the franchises of the corporation, has been held a per- niciousand unlawful compact. Fisher r. Bush, 35 Hun, 041 (1885). An irrev- ocable proxy is prohibited by statute in New York. It may be revoled even though coupled with an interest, in this case being to a pledgee. Re Germi- cide Co., 05 Hun, 000 (1892). A proxy, for five years, given so as to unite enough stock to control the corporation, the holder of the proxy agreeing that the person giving the proxy shall have an office at a salary of $2,500 a year, is void.

Commonwealth v. Dalzell, 152 Pa. St. 217 (1893), the court saying: "Tile general rule is that as between the corporation and the person offering to vote, the right follows the legal title, of which the certificates and the stock books are the prima facie evi- dence. By-laws mayestablish a differ- ent rule, and there may be special cir- cumstances to change the equities as to individuals or even as to the corpo- ration." Where stock is transferable only on the books of the corporation, the person in whose name the stock stands on such books is entitled to vote it, and the books of the company are conclusive upon the question as to who is entitled to vote stock legally issued. Morrill v. Little Falls Mfg. Co., 63 Minn. 371 (1803); Exparte Willcocks, 7 Cow. 402 (1827), stating, however, that in cer- tain cases, like that of stock ield for

Ferris, 4° Conn. 500, r08 (1875), sustaining a vote hy a bank- rupt, the ,ourt saying: "Theo party who appears to be the owner by the books of the corporation has tle right to be treated as a stoctkholltr and to vote on whatever stock stands in lils name:" Ilopptn t Buffuin, 0 I. 513, 518 (1870), the court saying: " In a case of a dispute as to a right to vote, the books ot the corporation aro the l)rimac faeie evidence; at any rate, the corpo- ration cannot be required to decide a disputed right. . .. Upon any other rule it could never be known who were entitled to vote, until the courts had decided the dispute." Alien v. Hill, 10 Cal. 113 (1800); Re St. Lawrence Steam- boat Co.. 44 N. J.

			§ 012. The . ight of trustcee, plegeos, adminlistrators, eto., to voto.- It is the general rule that a person holding stock as trustee is entitled to vote upon the stock, not only where he is duly regis- tered as a holder of stock in trust, but also where ho is registered absolutely as a stockholder upon the books of the corporation.&#x0027; If the trustoes disagree as to how the stock shall be voted, the courts have power to direct them.2 A trustee of stock has the right to vote thereon even for a consolidation, and even though hoe holds it donburgl v. Broadway R. R, 20 Hun, 848 (1883); People v Tibbots, 4 Cow. 858 (1825). Wloro the statute limits the votes to stock that for ten days has boon entered on the stock book, a stock- holder cannot vote who mailed a cer- tificato for transfer the day before the ten days began, if the oorporation did not receive the same until six days thereafter. The object of the statute is to onable persons to ascertain during the ton days who are entitled to vote. Under the New York statute a person who has sold his certificate of stock can- not vote. Re Glen Salt Co., 17 N. Y. App. Div. 234 (1807); asf&#x0027;d, 153 N. Y. 088. As to closing the books, see also § 538, supra. Where a statute forbids the voting of stock which has been trans- ferred within twenty days prior to an election, and in a corporation having sixty shares of stock thirty-two &#x0027;shares are voted, four of which were trans- ferred on the day of election, the court will declare the election void.

L 513, 510, (1870), the court saying: "If the trust was of such a nature that the trustee has the control and manage- ment of the property, and is to exercise his discretion concerning it, then he is the proper person to represent and vote upon it. And the corporation cannot be required to examine into the nature of the trust, with a view to decide as to the right to vote; " Re Barker, 6 Wend. 509 (1831); Re Mohawk, etc. .&#x0027;

D. 70 (1877). In Clarke v. Central R. R, 50 Fed. Rep. 838 (1802), it was held that a trust company has no power to hold as trustee and vote the majority of the stock of a great railroad system, especially where it is also the trustee in a trust deed of the company, the court saying: "There are many situations in which stock may be so placed that it becomes in- equitable or illegal for it to be voted. Tile law places the voting power of pledged stock in the pledger or mort- gagor, even where there is no express stipulation to that effect. And where the pledgor or mortgagor is disqualified to vote the stock, the disqualification extends as well to the pledgee or trus- tee." In this case, however, on the final hearing, the bill was dismissed. See 62 Fed. Rep. 328 (1894). Even though a statute requires that certificates run- ning to trustees shall state who is the cestui que trust, yet an election may be legal though stock is voted by trustees and such stock does not state who is the real owner. State v Cronan, 23 Nev. 437 (1897). 2Wanneker ut Hitchcock, 88 Fed. Rep. 383 (1889).

			for another corporation.&#x0027; A trustee holding stock and electing himself the president of a company and receiving a salary must not allow his personal interest in the salary to conflict with his duty as a stockholder to favor the sale of the corporate property at a high price.2 Whore a mortgage covers shares of stock and the trustee has the voting power, its discretion cannot bo controlled by the majority of the bondholders.&#x0027; A mortgage on shares of stock does not prevent the corporation controlled by such stock from issuing a mortgage on its property; and it is no breach of trust for the trustee of the first mortgage to be the trustee of the second mortgage where the first mortgage toes not prohibit such second mortgage, the stock, by the terms of the mortgage, reomain- ing in the name of the mortgagor.4

Schweyer, 18 N. Y. App. Rep. 830 (1897). Where a trustee hold- ing stock votes himself into office and illegally votes to himself a large salary, the cestuia que trust may in a suit for his removal ask also that he account to such cestuis que trust for such salary. Elias v. Schweyer, 27 N Y. App. Div. 09 (1808) Where a majority of the stock of the corporation passes by will to a trustee of the estate, and he makes himself president, and increases his sal- ary, and pays little attention to the business, and tries to sell the company out to a consolidation, and does not properly divide the income between life tenant and remaindermen, and causes the company to sell its reserve, and is responsible for the company losing its most valuable contract, and is unable to agree with a cestui que trust, the court will remove him from the trusteeship. Lister v. Weeks, 00 N. J. Eq. 215 (1900). See a c., 47 Atl. Rep. 588 (N. J. 1900). Even though a trustee of stock who has been an offi- cer and stockholder in the corporation is voted a salary, this is no ground for
			removing him as trustee, there being no proof that he voted in favor of the salary. Neither is the fact that the company did not pay as large dividends as it formerly did any ground for the removal of the trustee. Dailey v. Wight, 51 AtL Rep. 38 (Md. 1902). 3Toler v. East Tennessee, etc. Ry., 07 Fed. Rep. 108 (1894). 4 Gasquet v. Fidelity, etc. Co., 79Fed.

It is denied that the transfer book is binding upon the inspectors of election, and the decisions to that effect in New York are stated to be based on the New York statutory law. State v. Smith, 15 Oreg. 08 (1887). See also Allen v. Hill, 1G Cal. 113 (1860), to substan- tially the same effect. It has been held that the pledgee of stock is not even entitled to notice of meetings. Mc- Daniels tv Flower Brook Mfg. Co., 22 Vt. 274 (1850). 4The pledgor and pledgee of stock may agree between themselves as to who should vote the stock. If there is no agreement, the right to vote should follow the legal title; in other words, the title as it appears on the corporate books. Even under a statute author-
			izing inspectors of election, upon a challenge, to determine whether the- party who appears to be the owner is really the owner, the pledgee is entitled to vote the stock standing in his name where there is no agreement to the contrary, and even though the stock stands in the pledgee&#x0027;s name "as trus- tee." Commonwealth v. Dalzell, 152 Pa. St. 217 (1808). A pledgee into. whose name the stock has been trans- ferred may vote it. He is a " bonaflde " stockholder as required by the statute. The pledger cannot appear at the meet- ing and vote the stock. Re Argus Print. ing Co., 1 N. D. 434 (1801). It is not a conversion for one who holds stock as pledgee to attend corporate meetings and vote upon the stock. Heath v. Silverthorn Lead Min. etc. Co., 30 Wis. 140 (1875). 5J. H. Wentworth Co. v. French, 176 Mass. 442 (1000), holding also that the Massachusetts statute that a certificate of stock issued as a pledge shall state that fact on its face, enables the pledgor to vote without such proxy. If the cer- tificate merely states that it is given in pledge, without stating the name of the pledger, the pledgee to whom the cer- tificate runs may vote the stock. The- court may, however, refuse to grant a mandamus declaring certain persons duly elected directors where they were elected by the vote of the pledgee as against the wishes of the pledgor.

			In Now York, however, the more logical rule is laid down that a court of equity has no power to restrain a railroad corporation, which has legally purchasod a majority, of the stock of another railroad corporation, " from voting on the stock so purchased, upon the allegation, or proof, that it intends to cause a board of direct. ors to be oleoted, who, by their action or non-action, may injure or prejudice the interests of the minority stockholders of the corpora- tion whose stock has boon so purchased."

The court said: "It is against public policy to have or permit one cor- poration to embarrass and control an- other and perhaps competing corpora- tion in the management of its affairs, as may be done if it is permitted to purchase and vote upon the stock." In Louisiana it is held that where one cor- poration acquires stock in another cor- poration without authority so to do, the former may collect the dividends on such stock and may sell it, but cannot vote it, and hence that directors elected by such vote may be ousted by quo iwarranto proceedings State v.

Prudential Ins. Co., 53 Atl. Rep. 812 (N. J. 1003). The counsel in this case claimed that the following situation was legal: "One man con- trols a company of $10,000,000 capital. He may form a new company, with a capital of $5,100.000, to hold a majority of the stock. He may then sell all but ,,6(00,000 of the stock in company No. 2, and transfer his remaining stock to a new company with a capital of $2,600,000. He may then sell to com- pany No. 3 all but $1,400,000 and trans- ser that to a new company. This pro- cess may go on until the power of the whole chain of corporations is vested in the holder of a few tlousand dol- lars of stock in the ultimate company, and the same chain can be used for an unlimited number of companies." In reply to this the court said that such a situation, if it should arise, might lead to the following questions: "First. Whether the holders of the $4,900,000 of stock could not disfranchise the new irresponsible adventurers who assumed
			to wield the voting power of the $5,100,000 of stook.- disfranchliso this stock until the beneficial owners of it should take control of their own prop- erty and use its voting power. Second. Whether the actual, beneficial owners of the $5,100,000 of stock could not break through the chain of corporate fictions which separated them from their property, and dictate how its voting power should be exercised. Third. Whether it would not be the duty of the attorney-general of the state to take proceedings to dissolve the holding companies, as an abuse of corporate franchises,- as a fraud upon the extremely liberal provisions of our corporate act, which, however, permit the incorporation of companies only for a &#x0027;lawful purpose.&#x0027;" &#x0027;In Walker v. Devereaux, 4 Paige, 220, 247 (1833), Chancellor Walworth said: "This court unquestionably has the power to prevent this election by an injunction operating upon the com- missioners, restraining them from act- ing as inspectors of the election."

			A court of equity may enjoin tile majority stockholders from holding a now election, even though they claim that tho former election was invalid.&#x0027; prioty of equitablo interferenco by inl junction with the election of officers of privatto corporations Ihas been fre- quently criticised, and willi no incon. siderable show of justice, tho jurisdio- tion itself, although sHparingly exer- cised, is too firmly established to bo readily shiakel without tho intorvon. tlon of legislative authority. The ju. risdiction is, however, almost entirely of American growth, the English au- thorities affording few instances of its exorcise." A court of equity has juris. diction on a bill in equity to enjoin an election, although the statute provides for a summary remedy by application to the court, where the relief asked for by the bill involves also the transfer of stock. Archer v. American, etc. Co., 50 N. J. Eq. 883.(1892). The holding of an election may be enjoined pending a suit which has been commenced to re- strain the voting the stock which has been illegally issued at less than par to friends of the directors in order to con- trol the election. Way v. American, etc. Co., 00 N. J. Eq. 203 (1000). Where a corporation has brought suit against its president for an accounting for money misappropriated by lim, and where the president owns a majority of the stock, the court may enjoin the holding of an election, it being shown that the president has power to elect a board of directors who may defeat the purposeof thesuit. Coxev. Huntsville, etc. Co., 129 Ala. 406 (1900). The court may enjoin the company from receiving any votes at an election unless the votes of the plaintiff are re- ceived. Brown v. Pacifio Mail, etc. Co., 5 Blatohf. 525 (1807); a a, 4 Fed. Cas. 420. In the latter case Judge Blatch- ford said: "As to the character of the injunction asked for, it is laid down in
			Judge Redflold&#x0027;s Treatise on the Law of Railways (vol. 2, sec. 221) that &#x0027; t has been common to produce a positive efTect, through an injunction out of chancery, by means of a prolibitory order,&#x0027; and that a mandatory order is, in courts of equity, seldom denied, un- less the renedy at law is perfectly ad- equate." In this case Judge Blatch- ford enjoined the election inspectors from holding any election until the further order of the court, unless cer- tain persons should first be permitted to vote certain stock; and also enjoined certain persons from voting any stock until after certain other persons had been afforded an opportunity to vote their stock. In Shllmerdino v. Welsh, 47 Log. Int. 20 (Phila. Corn. PI., Janu- ary, 1800), the court did not deny its power to enjoin the election, but said: "Tio case is not sufficiently clear to warrant a preliminary injunction that would prevent an election on the day named in the charter, and might cause the irreparable injury which such rem- edies are given to prevent." If the election is held in violation of an in- junction, this fact will be considered in quo ivwaranto proceedings People v. Albany, etc. R. R., 55 Barb. 344, 884 (1800). The injunction generally runs against the inspectors, president, di- rectors, officers, agents, servants, etc. Campbell v. Poultney, 0 Gill &#x0026; J. (Md.) 94 (1834). It has been held that an in- junction permanently forbidding the holding of any election whatever is an interference with the management of corporate affairs, to which the courts will decline to be a party; and such an injunction would, if granted, be void. People v. Albany, etc. R R, 55 Barb. 844 (1869), holding also that while an injunction forbidding inspectors to 1 Chiera v. Brevoort, 07 Mich. 038 (1893)

			A court of equity may also enjoin the voting of particular stock. In order to obtain such an injunction, however, tho complainant must show that the defendant intends to vote the stock; that lie has no equitable right to do so; that the effect of the voto will be to control the election; and that irreparable and pormanent injury will come to the corporation or to the stockholders unless tlh in- junction is granted.&#x0027;

			The general rule is that one stockholder has nothing to do with the motive of another stockholder. The injunction must be based on damage reasonably certain to ensuo.7 Accordingly, an injunc- tion will not be granted upon the ground that the stockholders against whom the injunction is sought are likely to obtain control of the affairs of the company, and that then they will probably fraudulently to prevent the complain. ants from voting. The court enjoined defendants from participating in any election unless plaintiffs&#x0027; votes were received thereat, and from restraining plaintiffs in their right to vote. 1 A stockholder may enjoin directors from postponing an annual election which comes in February, but which the directors by by.law have changed to October, thereby endeavoring to ex- tend their term.

			Whore an injunction has boon obtained on false affidavits and bill to control an election, and the proceedings in court are discontinued immediatoly after the election, the court will summarily vacate and set aside the election by reason of the abuse of tile process of the court and the fraud on tleo rights of the stockholelors. Anl ap- peal from an injunction against voting certain stock will bo dis- missed wllere the parties may, under a statute, apply to the court to review the election on affidavits.2 Where the statutes require a cor- poration to keep a book containing ell names of the stockholders and the stock held by each, and it fails to do so, a stockholder can- not obtain a mandatory injunction to the effect that voting at the annual election shall bo in accordance with a list of stockholders, as certified by the transfer agent and registrar of the corporation.3 The federal court has no jurisdiction of a suit by a stockholder to enjoin a corporation from allowing certain stock to be voted on various grounds, where there is no allegation that the complainant&#x0027;s holdings of stock are worth upwards of two thousand dollars.&#x0027;

Self-constituted directors without a reg- ularly organized meeting have not a good title to their office; and where subsequently the incorporators elected other directors, the latter may cause to be stayed an action brought in the name of the company by the self-con- stituted directors. John Morley Bldg. Co. v, Barras, [1801] 2 Ch. 880. The Pennsylvania statute giving the court power to control and supervise elec- tions where fraud, violence, or unlaw- ful conduct prevents a fair and honest election does not sustain an injunction obtained by majority stockholders- who withdrew from the annual meet- ing and held a separate election because a stock vote was not allowed on the election of chairman--against the board elected by the minority. Quo warranto is the only remedy. Jenkins v. Baxter, 100 Pa. St. 109 (1804). 1 Where the owners of the whole stock sell it, and part of them resign and place the representatives of the vendee in possession, and those who remain in the board do so at his request, but transfer to him their certificates of stock, and then subsequently, when the time for the annual meeting has gone by, they publish a notice of a meeting and con- ceal the notice from him, and elect a 1333 CII.

If the validity of a corlporate election arises incidentally in connection with a suit in equity, the court will pass upon the election. This may occur whero a bill is liled to enjoin a forfeit- board, and attempt to take possession, a court of equity will enjoin them. Equity is not obliged "to leave tile corporation and its lawful directors to tile remedy at law, always taking at least mouths, and in the meantime suffer the road to be operated and per- haps ruined by tle depredators, because they olaimi to bo directors dle facto or de jure." Johnston V. Jones, 23 N. J. Eq. 210, 220 (1872). Where the pledgee of stdok sells it out and buys it in himself, and at the annual election votes the stock by proxy, oven though the stock still stands on tile corporation books in the name of the pleodgor, and the pledgor claims that the sale is illegal and that the directors elected by the pledgee&#x0027;s vote intend to take action detrimental to the corporation, such pledgor is en- titled to an injunction against such directors acting as directors. Reynolds u Bridenthal, 57 Nob. 280 (1898). In Clarke v. Central, etc. Co, 54 Fed. Rep. 550 (1893), it appeared that, the board of directors having been illegally elected, "the voting power of the stock was en- joined, a new election ordered, and the court appointed receivers, not for the purpose of subjecting the properties to the claims of creditors. but to protect and to preserve them until they could be turned over to a legally elected board of directors, as proper trustees, who would have the r.glit under the law to take and operate the railroad in the interest of all concerned. The court further directed that, when this new election should have taken place, said new board of directors might apply to the court to have the property returned to the control of the properly consti- tuted officers of the corporation." In this case, however, on the final hearing,
			l:
			the bill was dismissed. See 02 Fed. Rlp. 828 (1801). Wlhere a corporation lhas an authorized capital of 05,000, but only $2,500 are directed by tho stockholders to be issued, it is illegal and fraudulent to Issue the remaining authorized capi- tal without giving tho oxis ting stock- holders a prior right to subscribe to sucl increased capital pro rata. Direct- ors elected by reason of such illegal issue will be enjoined from acting, where they are about to change the whole policy of the company. Humboldt, etc. Assoo. v. Stevens, 34 Neb. 528 (1802!.

			0109. Illcgfal or fradttlcnt electiols - Sta(t1tory remedyl b!y pec tition to a court of eqtitil.- In consequence of the delays and dif. ficultics attending tle remedy of lquo wareranto, statutes have been cnacted in nmany of the states which give courts of equity the power to review corporate elections at the instance of tlh parties aggrieved. Such statutes are found in Now York, New Jersey, Cali&#x0027;ornia, and other states. ]3y thoso statutes the court, sitting as a court of chancery, is empowered to review corporate elections, and to grant such relief as the particular circumstances and justice of the ease scenm to require.&#x0027;
			These statutes have proven to be among the wisest and best that legislatures ever enacted in regard to corporations. They furnish a spe)edy, silmple, just, and effectivo remedy for all complaints, and are free from useless technicalities and expense. Various decisions under these statutes are given in the notes below.3 Although by
			Ulinor v Manine, etc Co., 03 Ale. 324 (1899). 2 Under a statute authorizing a court to review elections, the proceeding may be in equity. Wlitehead v. Sweet, 126 Cal. 07 (1899). See also the cases in the next note. 3For various cases in New York, showing the wide powers exercised by the court under this statute, see Ex parte Holmes, 5 Cow. 420 (1826); Scho- harie Valley R. R Case, 12 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 394 (1872); Ex parte Desdoity, 1 Wend. 99 (1828); Vandeburgh v. Broad- way, etc. R. It, 20 Hun, 348 (1883); Strong v. Smith, 15 Hun, 222 (1878); Ea parte Wilcocks, 7 Cow. 402 (1827); Mick- les v. Rochester City Bank, 11 Paige, 118 (1844); Re Long Island R. R, 19 Wend. 37 (1837). In this case an elec- tion was set aside because the direct- ors had illegally declared certain shares forfeited for non-payment of instal- ments, and refused to record an assign- ment thereof so as to entitle the as- signee to vote. In a proceeding under the New York statute the strict rules as to the reception of evidence in civil actions do not apply. Re Argus Co., 138 N. Y. 557 (1893), holding also that the application will be heard by the
			court under the New York statute, al- though another party is joined as pe- titioner without authority. Under these statutes an election may be declared void by reason of the conspiracy, frauds, or trickery of a part of the stockhold- ers. People r. Albany, etc. R. R., 55 Barb. 844 (1869). A statute repealing the statutory remedy in chancery to review elections operates retrospect- ively as well as prospectively. Re New York, etc. Co., 23 Hun, 615 (1881). The statute authorizing a court of chancery to review elections and order new ones does not authorize the courts to issue a mandarmus to the inspectors of election in regard to counting votes by proxy and amending the return. People v. Simonson, 01 Hun, 338 (1891). &#x0027; Surprise and fraud upon part of the electors is ground for avoiding an elec- tion." People .t Albany, etc. R. R., 55 .Barb. 344, 303 (1809). In this case the place of an election was filled by one party with roughs as proxies brought there for purposes of intimidation, and for voting on vira voce votes, and for crowding out the regular voters. Peo- ple v. Albany, etc. R. R., 55 Barb. 379 (1809). In this case also, under the New York statute, in an equitable suit 1330

			tile award of arbitrntors stock is transferred to a certain party, and such party votes the stock at tleo next oloction, and thereafter the award is sot aside and the stock rctransrerie(d, yot the party so brought by til state, the court ap- poilntd a receiver nnd issued all Injunc- tion pending tlh suit, and finally de- clared elected persons who would havo received tile most votes of all votes that Iad boon legally cast, although thero lhad been two oloectios held at tile Hsain time by the two parties at diferent places in tile same town. Under the New York statute making tie transfer book conclusively binding upon tlo inspectors of election, the ill spuctors cannot exclude the vote of the registered stockholder although he holds tile stook merely as pledgee; but under the Now York statute allowing the courts to summarily review the elec- tion, tie court has power to go back of the transfer book and set the election aside, where the statute gave the pledgor the right to vote. Strong v. Smith, 15 Hun, 223 (1878). Tle above remedy does not apply to foreign cor- porations. See # 017, sIpri&#x0027;. "Where no allegation of fraud or deceit is made, the court cannot interfere under the power vested in it by the Revised Stat- utes to nullify or set aside the will of the shareholders as expressed by their votes." .Re Wellman, etc. v. Cianci- mino, etc. Co., N. Y. L J., Mlay 18, 1890. The corporation itself may apply under the statute for an order to the effect that the persons declared elected were legally elected. Re Pioneer Paper Co., 36 How. Pr. 111 (1805). Although officers in possession of the corporate property and management may, in pro- ceedings to have defendant&#x0027;s election declared illegal, obtain an injunction against the defendant&#x0027;s interfering with the management of property, yet where the plaintiff obtained the prop- erty and management by violence on the dayof tle commencement of thesuit notwithstanding an injunction against such violence, his injunction will be
			dissolved, Cianolinino v. Man, 20 N. Y. Supp. &#x0027;02 (1802). Tlh above remedy does not apply to ile legality of an elctloll of tle president by tie direct- ors. Re Caguey, N. Y, L. J., Sept. 15, 1801. As to the California btatute see Brewster v. Hartley, 87 Cal. 15 (1800); Wright v. Central California, etc. Water Co., 07 Cal. 582 (1885). The statutory power of the court to inquire into the legality of corporate elections does not apply to the "appointment" of a di- rector by the board to fill a vacancy due to a resignation. Wickersrnam v. Brittan, 93 Cal. 84 (1802). Nor does such a statute enable the director so "appointed" to settle the question of the legality of the election by applying to the court. Wickershamn v. Murphy, 03 Cal. 41 (1892). Where two groups of stockholders are contesting for control, the expenses of the litigation should not be borne by tile company. Wicker- sham v. Crittenden, 100 Cal. 820 (1895). Tie statute in New Jersey giving the chancery court power to adjudicate elections is unconstitutional, inasmuch as tile constitution vests that power in the supreme court only. Goldstein v. Ewing, 02 N. J. Eq. 00 (1901). Where the stockholders disagree, and two elec- tions are held in adjoining rooms at the same time, the court may consider tie ballots cast at both meetings in order to arrive at the proper result of the election. Re Election, etc. Grove Cem. Co., 01 N. J. L. 422 (1898). See also, in general, Re St. Lawrence Steam- boat Co., 44 N. J. L. 520 (1882), a case where proxies were illegally rejected. Although the inspectors admitted votes on insufficient evidence, yet if addi- tional and sufficient evidence is pre- sented to the court the election will stand. Conant t: Millaudon, 5 La.

Persons con- tracting with til corporation and creditors of the corporation can- not interfere; neither can the corporation ordinarily defend against its contracts on the ground thlat its ofilcors were not duly elected. If they are do facto olficers, third persons may deal with them as such.2 Nor is it every stockholder who may complain. A transferee of one of the stockholders who participated in the fraud will not be hoard to impeach the result of that fraud.3 And in general the plaintilr, a relator seeking to set asilde a corporate election, is barred of relief if he himself was guilty of misconduct or neglect, or if it appears that he has subsequently acquiesced with knowledge of the facts.4 It is a principle of law, also, that the legality of an election will not be inquired into upon the ground that illegal votes were cast, unless those votes were challenged at the election at the time when they were cast.5 The failure of a stockholder to attend the stockholders&#x0027; meeting is rot a waiver of his right to object to the acts of the meeting as ultra vires, even though the notice of the meeting stated what was to be done.0 The court will, however, who attacks it.

A stockholder who attends the election and votes, and does not object to others voting, although he knows they are doing so in violation of a by- law, cannot himself afterwards object to the legality 6f the election.

			§ 022o. oti,nq trusts anl poolinq af/rentllts - I.Rstrictio1ns on right to votl or sell stock-- Contracts as to voting, elections, direct- ors, and conttrol.--Tle control of a corporation generally deter. mines its success or failure. The control also gives power, patronage, )perquisites, salaries, and position. lence it is sought for. In a large corporation the absolute control generally requires more money than one mal n is able or willing to invest. Consequently, for many reasons, various stockholders unite to obtain and retain the control. There is always danger, however, that some of these stockholders may (lie, or sell their stock, or unite with some other parties to ob- tain control. Ilence, for twenty years last past, the business com- munity and the lawyers have been trying to find some legal way of so tying up a majority of the stock of a corporation as to pre- vent its being lost. Various plans have been tried, some of which have failed, some have been partially successful, and some almost a complete success. This whole subject may be divided as follows:
			(a) Contracts between stockholders to vote together. Contracts involving changes of officers, and payment of salaries.
			(b) Restrictions on the right to vote. (o) Contracts between stockholders not to sell their stock except to each other.
			(d) Charter provisions and by-laws restricting the right to sell the stock. Unincorporated associations.
			(e) Irrevocable proxies. (f) Deposit of certificates of stock with trustees, either with or without a transfer of same to the trustees.
			(g) One corporation owning and holding the stock of other cor- porations.
			Taking up those various modes of uniting the majority of the stock, the first is
			§ 622a. Contracts betwveen stockh;o7ders to vote together- Con- tracts involving changes of officers, anll 1ayiment of salaries.- It is elementary law that stockholders owning a majority of.the stock have a right to combine and control the election of the board of directors.&#x0027; lined such person was to share in the could lawfully agree among themselves profits of short sales, is illegal and ndt to vote as a unit to control an election; enforcible. Veazey v. Alien, 173 N. Y. and that their agreement that their 859 (1903). votes should be cast as should be de- 1 Havemeyer v. Havemeyer, 43 N. Y. cided by the majority of their own Super.

			Several parties in purchasing stock may agree that each one&#x0027;s share shall be transferred to him, but that all the stock shall be voted for five years in one way, that way to be determined by a majority of the stock so included in the agreement. Such an agree. mont is legal, especially as it provides that (uring that time the parties shall retain the power to voto such stock.&#x0027;
			Thus, executors holdling a majority of the stool of a corporation may, in order to sell a portion thereof, agree with the purchaser that they will vote for two persons named by the purchaser to act as directors so long as the executors hold tho remainder of the stock, and the court will grant an injunction against the executors voting in violation thereof.2 An executory contract, however, between stockholders that they will vote in a certain way or elect certain persons as directors will rarely be enforced,specifically by the courts, and an action at law for damages for breach of contract is unsatis- factory in that, as a rule, no substantial damages can be proven.3 pany to give his vote merely with a view to what .other persons may con- sider the interests of the company at large. He has a right, if he thinks fit, to give his vote from motives or prompt- ings of what he considers his own in- dividual interest." A stockholder who signs an agreement with others to vote their stock as a unit cannot afterwards complain of acts of the board of direct- ors, which acts were in accordance with the policy of the pooling agreement. Ziegler v. Lake St. El. R R., 69 Fed. Rep. 176 (1895), giving portions of the agreement. "It is not per se unlawful for a number of persons, by previous agreement, to buy shares of the stock of a corporation for the purpose of con- trolling its policy, electing its officers, etc." Beitman v. Steiner, 98 Ala. 241 (1893). Where two partners desire to incorporate, and each to have the same interest, and a third party to have a smaller interest, thereby holding the balance of power, and such arrange- ment is carried out, and the third party is really a dummy of one of the part- ners, and thereby gives the control of the corporation to that partner, yet the other partner has no legal cause of com- plaint, notwithstanding the general un- derstanding as to the division of con-
			trol. Baumgarten v. Nichols, 00 Hun, 210 (1893). Although a contract of cer- tain stockholders to vote together is legal, yet a conspiracy to obtain an ille- gal injunction against others voting will not be countenanced by the court. People v. Albany, etc. R It, 55 Barb. 844, 868 (1809). 1 The court consequently held that a member of the syndicate who refused to vote in accordance with a decision of the majority had no right to vote (by reason of the California statute pre- scribing that only bonafide holders of stock should vote), the court holding that the original purchase of the block of stock bound that stock in its vote. Smith v. San Francisco, etc. Ry., 115 Cal. 584 (1897). 2 Greenwell v. Porter, [1002] 1 Ch. 530. Where by contract between two stock- holders owning an equal share in the corporation, future stock acquired by either of them is to belong one-half to each, such contract may be specifically enforced. Stewart v. Pierce, 89 N. W. Rep. 234 (Iowa, 1902). See on this point § 820 3, 38, supra. s An agreement that a certain person shall be president for two years will not be specifically enforced by the courts. Dulin v. Specific, etc. Co.. 103 1843 011.

			A contract by which tile directors who own a majority of tho stock soil such stock ant agree to substitute tle vendooe s as direct ors of tlh coimpany is legal.L Cal. 357 (1891), holding also that tn elec- tion in whlich the party is not oven elected a director will not be set aside, oven under the statutory power of the courts to set aside elections on equi- table grounds. A court of equity will not grant specific performance of a con. tract to vote stock as the complainant stockholder wishes, with a view tocon- trolling the corporation. Hence where the promisee of such a contract knows the promisor will not fulfill his con- tract, and consequently the promisee buys the promisor&#x0027;s stock at a high price. he, the promisee, cannot rescind such purchase. but must pay the stipu- lated price.

Rep. 343 (1890). A contract between a stockholder and a third person by which the third person is to be made a director, and agrees to devote his time and attention to the business, and develop the property, and procure the construction of a railroad, and cause various lots of land owned by the cor- poration to be sold, will not sustain an action at law for damages by the stock. holder for breach of tile contract. An action in such a case may be main- tained only by the corporation or by the stockholder in its behalf. So far as the contract intended to control the action of the board of directors it was illegal. Kountze v. Flannagan, 19N. Y. Supp. 33 (1892). An agreement that certain persons should have control of the corporation until certain debts were paid must be clearly proved before it will be sustained by thecourts Proctor, etc. Co. v. Finley, 98 Ky. 405 (1895) A contract between two companies by which one is to name four of the six
			directors of the other (and is also to sell the stock of the latter, carry out its contract, and pay dividends on its stock) is illegal. James v. Eve, L. R. 0 II. L. 335 (1873) Even though a partnership transfers its assets to a corporation, each partner taking an equal proportion of the stock, except that a third party was given the balance of power, and such third party afterwards acts with one of tile part- ners and controls the corporation, yet this is not sufficient to set aside atrans- ser of tle assets to the corporation at the instance of the other partner. Baunigarten v. Nichols, 09 Hun, 210 (1893). I A contract to sell one&#x0027;s stock in a corporation and to resign a directorship and the presidency. and, laving done so, to endeavor to induce other direct- ors to resign.in orderthat tle purchasers of the stock may come in and take their places and so control the manage- ment of the company, there being no evidence of fraud, has been held a con- tract not void as against public policy. Barnes v. Brown, 80 N. Y. 527 (1880) A contract whereby a manufacturing corporation and all of its stockholders agreed tosell a certain proportion of the capital stock of said company and to sub- stitute two persons nominated by the vendee as directors in such iorporation is not presumed to be ultra virei., and a provision in such contract that the purclaser will carry on the business and divide profits every six months may be enforced by the corporation. Rider Life Raft Co v. Roach, 97 N.

			Such a transaction, howevoer, is closely scrntinized by the courts, andt if fraudulent, as a matter of fact, the retiring dlirectors are per- sonally responsible for any losses.

Raymond v. Colton, 101 Soed. Rop. 210 (1000). Where a di- rector, who is also treasurer, sells his stock to the other directors, it being a part of the sale that he give up his of- sices, the corporation may treat his of. sices as vacant. Anderson, etc. Co. v. Pungs, 127 Milch. 543 (1001). In the case of Ryan v. MIcLane, 01 lid. 175 (1000), the court seemed to doubt some- what this statement that it is legal for the board of directors who own a ma- jority of the stock to agree to sell it and substitute the vendees as directors of the company. It would seem, however, as if such a contract would in its effect be no different from the common pro- vision which appears in the statutes of many of the states and in the by-laws of many corporations, that a majority in interest of the stock may at any time remove any of the directors and elect others in their place. A sale of the majority of the stock, together with a statutory power to remove the directors, is the same as a sale of the majority of the stock with a voluntary agreement to have the directors resign and new ones substituted.
			1Where the officers and directors, in a conspiracy, resign their offices and substitute other officers who are irre- sponsible and untrustworthy, in con- sideration of unlawful payments made to the former directors, and the assets of the corporation are thereby lost, the first named directors are personally re- sponsible for their action and a receiver of the corporation may hold them liable. Bosworth v. Allen, 108 N. Y. 157 (1901). A director of an assessment life insurance company who receives money

MoClur v. Law, 101 N. Y. 78 (1800). See also Gilbert v. Finch, 178 N. Y. 45 (1003). Money re- ceived by a director of a co-operative insurance company for substituting other directors and transferring its business to another company can be recovered back on the ground of fraud, and such director is chargeable with notice of the facts whicl he knew or might have learned by the exercise of reasonable care.

Stone, 42 Barb. 160 (1864), the court stating that such a contract is unfair towards the minority stockhold- ers. See also Jacobs v. Miller, 15 Alb. L. J. 188 (1877). Directors have no power to contract with an outsider that he shall, upon purchasing certain stock, be made a director in the company, but a sale of stock with an agreement that the vendee should be elected superin- tendent may be rescinded if the latter part of the agreement is not carried out.

Camden, 15 U,. S. 507 (1890). A contract made by a stockholder for a consideration to vote for a particular person for manager of tlhe company, and in the event of his election to vote for an increase of the salary attaching to that position, is illegal and cannot be enforced. Woodrulf v. Wentworth, 133 Mass 30D9 (1882). An agreement of persons holding a majority of the stock, they being directors also, that a person purchasing stock from them shall be general manager, and may it the end of two years sell the stock back to them at a stated price, is contrary to public policy and void. The vendors need not repurchase. The arrangement is un- fair to the corporation. Wilbur v. Stoepel, 82 Mich. 344 (1800). A proxy for five years, given so as to unite enough stock to control the corporation, the holder of the proxy agreeing that the person giving the proxy shall have an office at a salary of $2,500 a year, is void. At the instance of the latter per- son a court of equity will enjoin voting thereunder. Cone v. Russell, 48 N. J. Eq. 208 (1891).

A contract by which a stock- holder in a corporation agroes to so- cure to the purohaser of his stock a corporate offic at a stated salary, and in case of his removal to ropurchase the stock, is void as against public pol- icy and as a fraud on other stockholders, unless it is proved tllat the transaction is not for the private bonetit of the vendor, or that it was, consented to by thi other stockholders Guernsey v. Cook, 120 Mass. 501 (1870); Noyos v. Marsh, 123 Masa 280 (1877). A contract to preserve the control and stattu quo was involved in Harris v. Scott, 07 N. H. 437 (1893). The contract provided for voting on all subjects, for salaries, and for sales of stock before and after death. The court refused to grant speoifio performance for sale after death. Where three persons, being the owners of a majority of the stock, agree that they will vote their stock to elect as directors three persons to be named by one of them, and two persons to be named by the others, and that one of them, who received a salary of $2,500, should receive a salary of $5,000, and that two of such directors should receive a salary of $500 each, the agree- ment is illegal. now v.

A contract by which a purchaser of a majority of the stock of three corporations agrees that the corporations should employ the seller of the stock at a iixed salary for a certain time, and after a certain time the seller to have a salary and one-half of the directors, is illegal, and cannot be enforced by the vendor as against the vendee, even though the stock has been delivered and paid for under such

A contract of sale of stock wheoroby the vondeeo is to bo voted a certain salary and an equal representation it the board, and in case either party wishes to sell stock it is first to be offered to the other party at a fixed price, is void as an attempt to barter away the offices. Fennessy v. Ross, 90 Hun, 208 (1805). Whore a part of tih consideration of a contract in regard to voting stock in a certain way is that one of the parties shall be given an official position in the corporation at a salary, the contract is void and un. enforceable. Gage v. Fisher, C N. D. 207 (1805). In the case of Witham v.

A person who contracts to purchase stock may defend against an action for the price by setting up that the vendor falsely represented that the vendee was about to be deprived of the presidency of the company; and that thereby the vendee was induced to make the con- tract of purchase at an unconscionable price. Delano v. Rice, 23 N. Y. App. Div. 827 (1897). Where the agreement was to keep the vendor in a professor- ship, the court will not aid the parties. The agreement is against public policy. Jones v.

			benefiting the bank and does benefit it.&#x0027; Where part of the con- sideration in the sale of stock is that the vendor resign an ouice in the company, and the vendee be elected in his place, and this has been carried out, the vendee cannot rescind for fraud unless he re- signs the position or does something towards restoring the vendor to his former position.2 An agreement by a stockholder to give a person part of his stock if such person accept the position of a di- rector is not necessarily against public policy.3 A contract by which stock is contributed for the purpose of developing the busi- ness of the company is legal.4 But the common undertaking must be a legal one.&#x0027; The vendor of stock may of course agree to vote as the vendee wishes.6
			Closely connected witl the above principles of law is the question whether a director or stockholder may vote his stock in favor of a sale of corporate property to, or a lurchase of property for the corporation from, another corporation in which such director or stockholder is interested as a stockholder. The general rule is that a contract between two corporations having certain stockholders or directors in common will he sustained by the courts if the con- tract is fair towards the minority stockholders. If it is so unfair as to amount to a fraud, the courts will set it aside upon the com- plaint of the minority stockholders.7

			shall be by the stockholders and not otherwise.&#x0027; There is no rule of public policy which forbids a corporation and its stockholders from making any contract they please in regard to restrictions on the voting power. If the agreement is made by unanimous con- sent it is legal. Such restrictions, however, generally are, and al- ways should be, printed on the certificates of stock, so that a pur- chaser may take with fu&#x0027;l notice. A Ib-law passed at the time of the organization of the company may limit the number of votes which a single stockholder may cast;2 unless, of course, the stat- utes provide to the contrary.3 Under the partnership association statute of Pennsylvania, a by-law may be enacted taking away the voting power from any stock which is sold, even though it is pur- chased by an existing member.4 All this is a matter of private contract. Where the charter limits the number of votes which one stockholder may cast, the provision cannot be evaded by trans- sers to various persons. The courts will enjoin the voting of the stock.s Under the reserved right to amend, the legislature may of the directors and the stockholders chose one-third until the debt was re- duced to a certain figure. 1A contract and by-law giving a voting power to bondholders at corpo- rate elections is void as against public policy and the statutes, where the stat- utes prescribe that the directors shall be elected by the stockholders and shall not be elected in any other manner. Durkee v. People, 155 111. 354 (1803), aff&#x0027;g s C, 53 I11L App. 30 (1893). 2A by-law may provide that stock- holders shall have one vote for each share held by them up to ten shares, and may fix the proport on which their votes shall bear to their shares above that number. Commonwealth v. Det- willer, 181 Pa. St. 614 (1890). Cf. notes below. 3 A by-law restricting the right of members of a church to vote as author- ized by statute is void. People v, Phil- lips, 1 Denio, 388 (1845). A by-law re- stricting the right of electors in a town to vote is not good. Rex v. Spencer, 3 Burr. 1827 (1766); Rex tt Head. 4 Burr. 2515, 2521 (1770). See also § 4a. supra; People tv Kip, 4 Cow. 388, note (1822) holding that a corporation has no power, by a by-law, to demand an oath of a
			stockholder in order to test his qualifi- cations as a voter. Where the charter authorizes the depositors and stock- holders to elect new members, the di- rectors cannot by by-law exclude the former from elections and give a vote to stockholders only.

Where stock has been transferred in order to give it a vote, the transferrer having already all the stock that the charter allows one stock- holder to vote, the transfer being merely nominal and for voting pur- poses only, an injunction will issue against its being voted. Webb v. Ridgely, 38 Md. 864 (1878), where stock had been colorably transferred without consideration for the purpose of con- trolling an election, there being a pro- vision in the charter prohibiting a single stockholder from voting on more than twenty shares.

			change tile charter of a library corporation, so that each share shall have one vote, instead of restricting the vote of thoso who hold more than live shares. A by-law that all purchasers of stock shall agree that the stock shall be voted in favor of increasing thn capital stock is void as in restraint of trade and as an unreasonable limitation on the voting power of a stockholder.&#x0027;
			A statute prohibiting a stockholder from voting "whoso liabil- ity is past due and unpaid " refers to a subscription liability and not to a commercial liability.3 Even though the purchaser of for- feited stock may not be liable for unpaid calls, yet, under tle charter, lie may be unable to vote such stock, unless he pays suchl unpaid( cnlls.4 The right to vote is generally restricted by tlh charter to those who are registered stockholders.5 In some states the right to vote is limited to those who have been stockholders of record for a certain number of days before the election.6 Whore a company attaches conditions to its acceptance of a subscription, tile subscriber is not entitled to vote until the conditions are complied with.?
			§ 622c. Co)ntracts between stockholders not to sell t7her stock cxcp)t to each othier.- A stockholder has a right to sell his stock at any to a theatre was given to stolckholders. Although a person transfers stock to another in order to evade a statute which prohibits any one stockholder from voting on any more than one- eighth of the capital stock, yet the person to whom it is transferred may make a valid agreement to retransfer the same and the court will enforce this agreement. Scott v. Scott, 08 N. H. 7 (1894). Although the charter lim- its each person to one hundred votes, yet a person voting a hundred votes in his own name may vote another hun- dred as proxy for his wife, if it is bona fide her property. Conant : Mlillaudon, 5 La. Ann. 542 (1850). A statute which confines the right to vote to stockhold- ers who are citizens of the state by which the corporation is chartered can- not be evaded by colorable transfers of shares to residents of the state merely for the purpose of having them voted upon. State v. Hunton, 28 Vt. 594 (1856). Such a statute would now, however, probably be held to be unconstitutional. See § 813, infra, relative to statutes
			prohibiting citizens of other states from being trustees. But see Campbell v. Poultney, 0 G. &#x0026; J. 94 (1834). In England it is not illegal to transfer or procure shares before a meeting so as to multi- ply votes at it; nor can votes so ob- tained be disregarded. They may bo cast. Pender v.

Even though he owns a majority of tile stoql thoro is no principle of law obliging him to provide for the sale of others&#x0027; stock when heosells his own.&#x0027; Ilenco, contracts are often entered into between a portion or all of the stockholders of a&#x0027;corporntion to tile effect that they will hold( and sell their stoolc together. Such a contract is legal.&#x0027; The dilliulnty with such a contract, howover, is that upon a breach thereof only the actual loss suffered and not the full value of the stock of the injured party is recoverable in damages.3 lIonco, such a contract should contain a provision obli- gating the selling stockhioller to buy the stock of the others.4
			Another form of contract is to the effect that before any of the stockholders sell their stock they shall first offer it to the other 1 "Wo do not understand that one stockholder is, by virtue of his owner- ship of stock, bound to continue in tile holding of it in order to allow another stockholder to mako a prollt out of ne- gotiations thon pending. . . . We do not understand that a stockholder is under obligations, legal or moral, to sacrifico his personal interests in order to securo the welfare of the corpora- tion of which he is a stockholder, or to enable another stockholder to make gains and profits." Farmers&#x0027; L. &#x0026; T. Co. v. Chicago, etc. Ry., 163 U. S. 31, 44 (1890). 2In Havomeyer v. Havemeyer, 43 N. Y. Super. Ct. 500 (1878); s. c., 45 N. Y. Super. Ct. 461 11870); af&#x0027;d, 86 N. Y. 018 (1881), it was held that an agreement of several stockholders not to sell their own stock except in connection with that of the other parties to the contract was not in restraint of trade and was not contrary to public policy, as re- stricting the right of alienation, but the measure of damrtges for breach of sulc a contract is only the actual loss sus- sered by a decline in the value of the stock by reason of the breach. See also Griffith v. Jewett, 15 W. L. Bull. 419 (1886). 3 See p. 1353, infra. 4The following is a form of contract on this subject:

Brown, 171 Mlass. 118 (1898), in a close corporation, tho stooltholders made a contract, the essoutial parts of which aro set forth in the opinion of the court, providing for the purchase of the stock of a cor- tain stockholder in case of his death, and for the purchase of the stock of any other stockholder who ceased to be connected with the corporation. The former stockholder having died, the court granted spocillo performance of the contract and cuolpolled his estate to deliver the stock upon payment of the specified price. 54 At). Rep. 48. Where one person advances money to another to purchase a certain stock on an agreement that they will co-operate, and in case the latter wishes to sell he will not sell to unfriendly parties with- out giving the former the first chance to purchase, and the stock is in the pos- session of the former as security for the loan, a sale by the latter to an un- friendly party with notice of the facts is not sufficient to sustain a bill in equity to compel the first-named party to transfer the stock to such purchaser. The court said: "One or more stock- holders in a corporation may agree to stand together in carrying out an hon- est business policy consistent with what they believe to be to the best in- terests of all the stockholders. This was not a pooling agreement, to vest the government of the corporation for a time in certain members of it, or to yield the control to a few who might, dominate, regardless of the interests of the many. It was intended to maintain a status of independence for the rail- way company that it might be operated under the purposes of its charter." Rigg v. Reading, etc. Ry., 191 Pa. St. 298 (1899) Where, in order "to enable the com-

Whiton v. Batchlldor, etc. Corp., 170 Mass. 100 (1001). A court will enjoin a party from voting upon or disposing of his stock in the corporation pencente lite where the plaintiffs show that they transferred the stock to the defendant on the latter&#x0027;s agreement not to sell the same, except with the consent of the former, and that when he did sell the stock three-fourths of the proceeds should apply to the former, and it ap- pearing further that the defendant had given the stock to his sister without consideration. Weston v. Goldstein, 89 N. Y. App. Div. 661 (1899). Where the majority stockholders agree in writ- ing that for three years they will give each other proxies on their stock to vote at elections, and during that time will not sell their stock unless all agree thereto, and further, that if any one de- sires to sell he will first offer his stock to the others, specific performance by way of injunction against a sale with- out the consent of the others will not be granted where at the time of trial the three years have already elapsed. The remedy, if there is any, isat law. Brown v. Britton, 41 N.Y. App. Div. 57 (1899).

It is a broach of contract, but the remedy is usually at law for dam- ages. Such also is tile rule as to a contract that a stockholder, before selling his stock to others, shall first offer the stock to the corporation itself. A personal agreement between the incorpora- tors, promoters, and proposed subscribers to the stock of a proposed corporation, by which agreeoment the corporation is to have the first right to buy the stock of any one who wishes to sell, does not prevent a sale by a stockholder without offering the stock to the corporation. Hence the corporation cannot refuse to transfer the stock.2 of the stock and the other 008 shares and a third person two shares, and the first partner agrees that in case he sells his 998 shares he will transfer the other two shares to his partner, such agree- nmet does not prevent the first partner from transferring single shares to qual- ify new trustees, inasmuch as the agreement does not prohibit his selling less than 998 shares. Burden v. Burden, 159 N. Y. 287 (1899). Where a cor- poration having treasury stock in its treasury sells all its assets to another corporation, excepting its patent rights, suoh sale is not a sale of the treasury stock within the meaning of a prior stock-pooling contract of the old corpo- ration that certain other stock should be sold before such treasury stock was sold. Myers v. Buell, 07 N. Y. App. Div. 290 (1001). Even though stock- holders agree not to offer their stock to others without first offering it to each other, yet, if subsequently some of them authorize the others to do as they think best in regard to the matter, and the latter dispose of some of the joint stock, they are protected in so doing. Smith v. Bierce, 104 Lia. 9 (1000). 1 The enforcement of specific perform- ance of such an agreement by a court of equity rests in the discretion of the court; it may not be demanded as a
			right. The fact that the transferee holds the stock subject to the enforce- ment of the equitable remedy does not in any way interfere with his legal title, nor does it preclude the corporation from treating him as, and according to him all the rights of, a stockholder, in- cluding the right to vote upon the stock at a stockholders&#x0027; meeting. Re Argus Co., 188 N. Y. 557 (1803).

Whiton v. Batchelder, etc. Corp., 170 Mass. 100 (1901). See 78 N. Y. App. 007. 1 Where a stockholder agrees to trans- ser his stock to the company at an ap- praisal to be made by the directors, the decision of the directors cannot be im- peached by showing that they commit. ted errors of judgment in the appraisal A stockholder may be forced to spe- cifically perform a contract to convey his stock to the corporation, according to an appraisal made by the directors, to be disposed of by them as they may see fit, where the evidence slows that none of the stock of said corporation has ever been sold on the market ot otherwise than by transfer to the di. rectors, and no fraud in the appraisal is charged. and the remedy by an action for damages would be inadequate.

Thus, where two patentees agree to own their patents in common, and then contract with a corporation to convey the patents to it for stock to bo issued to them jointly, each to have one-h.alf, and each to have one-half the dividends thereof, the certificates not to be changed, sold, or pledged for ten years, except upon their joint consent, the instrument may also provide that one of them shall vote the stock as proxy for the ten years, unless both agree otherwise. The court held that such a contract is legal, being practi- cally a contract to become partners in the ownership of stock for ten years Hey v. Dolphin, 92 Hun, 230 (1895). 4 The various stockholders of a com- pany may give interchangeably a first option of thirty days to purchase their shares of stock whenever any one de- sires to sell, each contracting for him- self, the contract further providing that such thirty days were to coin- mence&#x0027;in case of the death of a stock- holder, so far as his stock was con- cerned; and they may further contract that another person is to have a simi- lar option in case the first option is not exercised. A party entitled to such option may have specific performance of it. The mutual covenants of the contract are a sufficient consideration to support it.

Such is not the fact. The right to sell it was not fettered for an In- stant. In(eedtl, by the terms of the con- tract provision is made for tih exercise of sucll right. The only limitation, if there was a determination to soll, was the privilege by the other party to buy upon certain conditions, and such con- ditions have never been hold invalid. This case does not fall within the prin- ciple announced in Fisher v. Bush (3. Hun, 041) and similar cases. Therein there was an express agreement not to sell for any purpose, and it was held void as against public policy. Here there was no limitation of the right to sell; it was only subject for a limited period to the right of the other party to buy. And an agreement which seeks to control the stock of a corl)pra- tion for purposes of management, law- ful in itself, is not subject to any in- firmity, but is the exercise of a legal right." Scruggs v. Cotterill, 07 N. Y. App. Div. 583 (1902). 1 An oral agreement whereby one party makes a loan to the corporation in consideration of the other party keeping the former in control and giv- ing him an option on the latter&#x0027;s stock does not sustain a suit for damages, even if broken by the latter, inasmuch as it is void, under the statute of frauds, as not to be performed witlin a year. Gazzam v. Simpson, 114 Fed. Rep. 71 (1902). 2 A unilateral contract is not binding. A consideration must exist or the cove- nants be mutual. Jordan v. Indian- apolis, etc. Co., 01 N. E.

An option to sell mining stock witll no definite time fixed as to the duration of the option may be revoked threo months later, no saleo having been made in the meantime, and a subse- quent sale by the owner of the stock at an advanced price to a party whom the party receiving the option had been negotiating with, does not entitle such party receiving the option to any inter- est in the sale. Rees v. Pellow, 07 Fed. Rep. 167 (1800), the court holding that such an option may be terminated at any time in good faith.

A by-law providing tiht, if any stockholder shall desire to dispose of his stock, lie shall give writtell notice of his intention to sell, and that the other stockholders sBlill thereupon have the option to pur- clhise the stock at the price namod, is an invalid restraint on alienation.

A by-law that all purchasers of stock slall agree that the stock shall be voted in favor of in- creasing tie capital stock is void as in restraint of trade and as attempting to limit the voting power of a stockholder. MoNulta v. Corn Belt Bank, 104 III. 427 (1807). Where a stockholder purchases certificates of stock which provide that they are transferable only to the com- pany, and at an appraisal to be made by its directors, as provided in the by- laws printed on the baok of the certifi- cates, and signs a receipt therefor, "subject to the conditions and restric- tions therein referred to, and to the by- laws of the company, to which I agree to conform," he is bound by the provis- ions of the certificates, though, when considered as by-laws, they may be void. In such case the records of a di- rectors&#x0027; meeting showing that, by vote of the directors present, a stockholder&#x0027;s shares were appraised at a certain price and taken for the use of the company, sufficiently show an appraisal, although no notice of hearing was given the stockholder. New England Trust Co. v. Abbott. 102 Mass. 148 (1894). Where by the by-laws any stockholder wish. ing to sell his stock must first offer it to the other stockholders, and a stock-
			holder dies and one of his heirs brings suit against the executors for his pro- portion of tile stock, and another heir claims that the stock should be sold, the corporation itself and all the other stockholders are necessary parties. Champollion v. Corbin, 51 Atl. Rep. 07, (N. H. 1001). The fact that tile by-laws require a stockholder, in case he wishes to sell, to first offer the stock to the corporation or other stookholders be- fore selling to others, does not affect tile validity of another by-law author- izing assessments on the stocl. Farm- ers&#x0027;, et. Co. v. Smith, 01 Atl. Rep. 009 (Conn. 1002). A by-law requiring stock- holders to offer their stock to the cor- poration itself before selling suol stock elsewhere is illegal, and a purchaser of a certificate of stock is entitled to a transferon the books, even though his transferrer agreed to the by-law and did not comply therewith. Ireland v. Globe, etc. Co., 21 R. . 9 (1898). Where a stockholder in a national bank in- dorses his certificate in blank, and causes it to be sold at public auction, and the auctioneer sells it to the cash- ier of the bank, and takes it to the bank, and presents it to such cashier for transfer, and for four years divi- dends thereon are paid to the cashier, the vendor is no longer liable, even though the stock was not transferred on the bank books, and even though a by-law of the bank prohibited any of- sicer from holding stock in the bank except by permission of the board of directors. Earle v. Coyle, 97 Fed. Rep. 410 (1809). A by-law that the stock shall not be transferable except to the corporation itself is illegal, even though it is expressed on the face of the stock certificates; and hence a stockholder cannot compel a corpora- tion to purchase his stook, even though 1356

Such a by-law is legal, and thl corporation may refuse to transfer thl stock in violation of tle by-law.&#x0027; A resolution of tho stook- holders that the company should not allow any further transfers of stock until the company is out of financial dlilHoultics does not bind a stockholder who did not take part in tleo meeting.2 Tlhe right of transfer is sometimes limited by statute, as where stook cannot be transferred until all calls thereon shall have been fully paid. Whore the charter or a statute forbids transfers before the full capital stock is paid in, any transfer before suell payment has been lold to be void.&#x0027; Thle Illinois statute against options does not apply to a contract by which tile vendor of stock agrees to buy it back at the end of five years if the vendor so desires, the venlde on his part agreeing not to sell the stock to any one in the meantime, without first offering it to the vendor.4
			In England sometimes express authority is given to the directors, by the articles of association, to refuse to permit a transfer unless the same is satisfactory to them.6 They have this power, however, only by express authority, and it is not extended by implication.* the corporation has purchased the stock of othor members, and even though the corporation is essentially a community of property affair, having a capital stock.

" Its en- forcement would operate as an infringe- ment upon the property rights of others, which the law will not permit. It would, besides, operate as a restraint upon the disposition of property in the stock of the corporation, in the nature of restraint of trade, which the courts will not tolerate." oni. XXxvii.]

			Similar to a charter restriction on the sale of stock is a provision in the articles of association of an unincorporated joint-stock associa- tion to the effect that no stockholder shall soll his stock except on specified conditions or that he shall not sell it at all, except to a party satisfactory to the other stockholders.

Ex p)arte Penney, L R. 8 Ch. App. 440 (1872).

In exercising it the directors must act in good faith in the interest of the company and with due regard to the shareholder&#x0027;s right to transfer his shares, and they must fairly consider the question of the transferee&#x0027;s fitness at a board meeting.&#x0027; It is not a sufficient reason that the transferee is not a member of a particular family, and the directors will be ordered to make the transfer.

			§ 622o. Irriwvoctblo proxis.-- Tho plan of trying to tie up tile con- tract of a corporation by obtaining irrevocable proxies from the holders of a majority of tile stock had to be abandoned, because the so-called "irrevocable " proxies, although irrevocable hy their torns, wore held by the courts to be revocable at any tilne.&#x0027; This plan of depositing the certificates of stock with trustees, without a, transfer on the books of the corporation, and then giving irrevo- cable proxies to the trustees, was one of the first plans tried. The courts, however, heold that inasmuch as the proxies were revocable, the plan of the trust itself bad failed, and hence the certificates might be demanded back.2 shall bo paid the value of itis stock, tlh company, by admitting him as to somn of the stock, admits him as to all, bu the fact that iho is already a holdor c some stock does not entitle him to b nhlmittod as to new stock purchased bl hIlin.

The transfer of such certificate as security need not be recorded as chattel morgage. Rommerdahl v. Jac sonI, 103 Wis. 444 (1899). Although a unincorporated association&#x0027;s article provide that transfers of stock shall b made only with consent of the direcl ors, yet, where such provision is so many years disregarded, a stockholde who so transferred his stock at a tim when the assets equaled the liabilitie cannot be held liable as a stockholder Wadsworth v.

			§ 622f. Deposit of certificato of stock with tlrust cca, either with or without a tra)lsfer of same1 to the trllstces.-This is the usual and most important method of tying up tile control of a majority of the stock of a corporation. It lias given rise to much litigation and moro or less conflicting decisions. Each case turns largely on the peculiar form of the lparticular contract under consideration, and yet there are certain general features and principles of law appli- cable to this form of contract, which are gradually dolening the limit between legal and illegal contracts of this nature. It has been objected that this mode of tying up the stock of a corporation violates the statute against restraint on the alienation of peorsonal property; that it is contrary to public policy, which favors a free transfer of property; that it is unfair towards minority stock- holders, and that it separates the voting power from the ownership of the stock. The leading cases on this subject are as follows:
			The Now York court of appeals has held that an agreement of several holders of stock to deposit their stock in a trust company for a term of six months and not to sell it during that time is legal, there being no provision depriving any party of his right to vote on the stock. The court held also that where compensation in damages for a breach would be inadequate, a court of equity might grant specific performance of such a contract by enjoining a breach thereof. Such a contract is not void as suspending the power of alienation, nor is it against public policy as being a restraint upon trade, the purpose of the contract being to prevent a sacrifice of the stock.&#x0027; I lWilliams v. Montgomery, 148 N. Y. 519 (1896), practically reversing 68 Hun, 410, and 74 Hun, 425. See § 81°, infra. The following decisions have also been rendered in New York state. In the case of Sullivan v. Parkes, 69 N. Y. App. Div. 221 (1002), the holders of a majority of the stock of a Delaware corporation entered into a written agreement, by which the certificates were deposited with a trust company for fifteen years, together with irrevo-, cable proxies to two specified persons to vote the stock during that time, and in case they disagreed they were to select a third party who was to decide between them, the proxies to be re- newed every three years, the owners retaining the right to sell or pledge their stock, subject always, however, to the agreement, and the purchaser to
			come into the agreement and execute similar proxies, and the agreement further providing that before any party sold his stock he should first offer it to the others at the same price at whicl he intended to sell. The two proxies failed to agree and could not agree on an arbitrator, and one of them filed a bill for an injunction to prevent the other from voting his own stock in violation of the agreement. The court held that the injunction would not lie because the contract had become im- possible of performance, by reason of the arbitrator not being provided for, and on the further ground that the agreement did not prohibit each stock- holder voting his own stock, in case the proxies could not agree, and the court doubted the validity of the irrev- ocable proxies, and doubted the valid- 1360 § csaf.]

			Tn 1001 the legislature of the state of Now York declared the public policy of that state, as to tile "pooling" of stock, by ennot- ing a statute under which stockholders may pool their stoolc by transferring tho snmo to a person to vest in him the right to vote Ity of a provision against tle stook- holder voting Ili stock, oven if tlhur had boon such a provision. Tile court intimated also that all agroemont pro- venting the sale of stook for fifteen years would be void under the Personal Property Law of Now York (L. 1817, clh. 417, § 2), and that the spirit of tlh statute militated against an agreement to give proxies for that length of time. A court will enjoin a party from vot- ing upon or disposing of his stock In a corporation pendente litc where tho plaintiffs sllow that they transferred the stook to the defendant on the lat- ter&#x0027;s agreement not to sell the same, except with the consent of the former, and that when he did sell the stock three-fourths of the proceeds should be- long to the former, and it appearing further that the defendant had given the stock to his sister without consid- eration. Weston v. Goldstein, 80 N. Y. App. Div. 601 (1899). In the case of United, etc. Co. v. Omaha, etc. Co., 164 N. Y. 41 (1900), where a reorganization committee, in carrying out the reor- ganization agreement, tied up the stock by giving to the committee the power to vote the same until certain divi- dends were paid, the court held that the committee had no such power under the original reorganization agreement. Trustees under a reorganization who are to hold a majority of the stock and vote the same for five years. unless they decide to distribute the same be- fore that time, are not precluded from selling stock owned by themselves indi- vidually, and the fact that they sell their own stock is no ground for compelling a distribution of the remaining stock. Haines v. Kinderhook, etc. Ry., 83 N. Y. App. Div. 154 (1898). An agreement of stockholders not to sell their stock except by concurrent consent of all the
			(80) 13
			signers to the agreement is void as In rostraiit of trade and against publio policy. Fisher v. Bush, 85 Ilun, 641 (1885). The trustees are not purohasers and owners of tile stock. People v. North River Sugar Ref. Co., 191 N. Y. 582 (1800). An outside stockholder cannot object to other stockholders uaiting their Interests In a "trust," and thereby obtaining control of the corporation. Zimmerman t: Jewett, 10 Abb. N. Caa. 451 (1880). An agreement of the holder of a majority of the stock that he will retain control is no defense by the cor- poration to an action by the receiver of such stockholder to transfer the stock on the corporate books. Weller v. Pace Tobacco Co., 25 N. Y. Week. Dig. 581 (1880). Where stock is deposited with a trustee for purposes of reorganization, and transferable certificates are issued therefor by the trustee, a claimant of stock which another person has de- posited, and for which such other per- son has the trustee&#x0027;s certificate. cannot compel the trustee to deliver up the stock until the trustee&#x0027;s certificate is returned, even though the party holding it isa party defendant. Bean v. Ameri- can Loan, etc. Co., 122 N. Y. 622 (1800). As to the nature of trustees&#x0027; certificates in general, see § 888, infra.

			the stock for a timno not exceeding fivo years, on such terms and conditions as therein set forth, provided other stockholders are al- lowed to come into the agreement. Tho stock may be transferred for that purpose on the books of tile company, the now certificates and tile corporate books to refer to such agreement, and the agree- ment itself to be filed with the corporation and to be open to the inspection of other stockholders.&#x0027;
			Tlho supreme court of Massachusetts has rendered a logical and clear decision on this question. It holds that an agreement of various persons to purchase a majority of the stock of a corpora- tion, the stock when purchased to be voted by a committee of live of the subscribers for at least three years, is not illegal even though the title to the stock is given to a trustee during that time. The court said: "We know nothing in the policy of our law to prevent a majority of stockholders from transferring their stock to a trustee with unrestricted pdwer to vote upon it. ... A stockholder has a right to put his shares in trust, whatever his motive. If the trust is an active one lie cannot terminate it at will; and the at- tempt to cut himself off by contract, instead of by the imposition of duties, from ending it, certainly is not enough to poison the cove- nant with the plaintiff. It might be held that the duty of voting incident to the legal title made such a trust an active one in all cases. As to tle arrangement for the trustees uniting to elect their candidates, the decisions of other states show that such ar- rangements have been upheld, and we do not think that it needs argument to prove that they are lawful. If stockholders want to make their power felt they must unite. There is no reason why a majority should not agree to keep together."2 holders for stock which the latter used in the interest of the company. Playa, etc. Co. v. Gage, 00 N. Y. App. Div. 1 (1901) Where a trustee or agent with whom bonds are deposited issues his certificate to the effect that he holds bonds specified in such certificate to be delivered to a person specified in such certificate, all coupons on such bonds belong to the person named in the cer-&#x0027; tificate, although the certificate itself is not actually delivered until several years after the date of the certificate. If such coupons have been canceled and returned to the corporation issuing the bonds, and the trustee is held liable for such coupons, the trustee may hold the corporation liable. Kelly v. Forty-

			In Now Jersey, also, the highest court has uphold a pooling agreement of stock of a terminal corporation, whereby for two and one-half years the stockholders turned over their certificates to certain persons, together with proxies, with power to vote on any question, Including the sale of the property, and to exchange the stock for stock in other corporations or to hypothecato it, the stockholders agreeing in the meantime not to sell their stock, tlh object being to finance and complete the enterprise, and hence a bill filed by one of the depositing stockholders to reclaimn his stock was hold not to lie.&#x0027;
			It has also boon hold in Now Jersey that an agreement between two stockholders by which certain stock is issued to a trustee to principal a right to damnges for failure to sell, where the principal delivered trustees&#x0027; receipts instead of the stock itself, the stock having been "pooled." Simmons v. Brooks, 150 Mss. 219(1803). The fact is that Massaohusetts has de- veloped and elaborated this plan of pooling stock much more than In other states In that state the trustees often issue trustees&#x0027; certificates of stock in the usual form of stock certificates That practically amounts to an unin- corporated joint-stock association, own- ing stock in one or more corporations, a subject already considered. See pp. 1061, 1858, supra. In fact it is diffi- cult to draw the line where such an unincorporated association ends and a "pooling" trusteeship begins. The courts are beginning to consider them as much the same, and both are legal modes of tying up stock. IThe court said: "This instrument, which gave the defendants control over the complainant&#x0027;s stock, appears to have been for acommon interest, it is consistent with the purposes for which the corporation was created, and its continuance appears to be necessary for the advantage of all who are inter- ested in the development of the prop- erty. A power of attorney may become irrevocable whenever the object is to create an interest; and this is so, even if it is not stated in the instrument itself to be irrevocable ... The statute does not in terms prevent a stockholder
			from giving an irrevocable power of attorney to vote at stockholders&#x0027; meet- ings, subject to the time limit as to elections, nor can we see any reason why a stockholder may not give sue) a proxy if he chooses, and be bound by it. Ho can easily avoid tle effect of it by appearing and voting in person at all meetings There is no statutory provision, nor can we perceive any reason offensive to public policy, pre- venting a stockholder from giving another powers over, or rights in, his shares in a corporation to the same ex- tent that he might give in any prop- erty." Thecourt alsosaid: "Noillegal purpose is manifest upon the face of this agreement, nor has any been alleged in the bill. It appears to be consistent with the purposes for which the company was created, and which continuance appears to be necessary for the advantage of all who are inter- ested in the development of the prop- erty. It is expressly declared to be for the benefit of all who join in it. No stockholder is prevented from joining in this agreement, and no stockholder who has not availed himself of the opportunity to join in it is excluded from the benefit of it. No one appears to have been injured by it. The com- plainant does not allege in&#x0027; what way he is damaged by its continuance." Chapman v. Bates, 47 AtL Rep. 638 (N. J. 1000), aff&#x0027;g 60 N. J. Eq. 17 (1000). 1363 ol. 3xxVIw.]

			be held by the trustee for eighteen months, unless sooner disposed of by consent of the parties, the stock in the meantimo to bo voted as directed by one of the parties, the stock at the termination of that period to ho divided between them in a certain way, is legal.&#x0027;
			On the other hand it has been hold by the lower court in Now Jersey that a stock-pooling agreement by which for five years the hollers of a majority of tie stock transfer it to trustees in exchange for certificates of the trustees themselves, and the trustees are given power to formulate a plan for financing the company and submit the same to such stockholders, who shall be bound thereby unless they object in a certain way, and tho trustees are then given power to carry out such plan, and stockholders who do not como into the agreement should not be entitled to any rights or benefits there- under, the trustees to elect such directors as they see fit, is illegal, and a stockholder who has not come into the agreement may enjoin the trustee from voting such stock, even though some of the trus- tees are beyond the jurisdiction of the court.2 1 If one of the parties, who had a right to prescribe how the stock should be voted, subsequently, but prior to the expiration of the agreement, sells his interest in the stock, such sale being made subject to the agreement, his right in regard to the voting of the stock does not pass to the purchaser. but vests in the trustee. "It is against the settled rules governing the control of corporations that an irrevocable power of voting or directing the votes on stock should be vested in a person who is neither interested in the stock nor a representative of persons inter- ested." The court said in regard to the duty of the trustee in holding the stock, " it must exercise this right and power honestly and in its best judgment as trustee, giving such weiglt as in its judgment it is entitled to, to the fact that the complainant, the owner ben-. eficially interested in the majority of the stock held in trust, is opposed to the change." The court said: &#x0027; It must be observed that the trust agreement is not simply a deposit for the purpose of voting, but is a trust to hold the stock for a limited period, to await the result of certain options of purchase, which affect the ultimate disposal of
			the stock." Clowes v. Miller, 00 N. J. Eq. 17 (1000). 2The court said: "If, however, the stockllolder undertakes to make irrev- ocable his grant of power, and to do. nude himself for a fixed period of tho power to judge and determine and vote as to the proper management and con- trol of the affairs of the corporation, then whether the grant of power is good or not must depend on the pur- poses for which it is given. When the scheme devised does not embrace a grant of irrevocable powers by proxy, but seeks a similar object by the crea. tion of a trust and the appointment of a trustee, to whom the title of the stock is conveyed, a like doctrine must be applied. If no provision is made for the conduct of the trustee, at least he would be bound to vote on the stock held in trust in accordance with the expressed wishes of the cestui que trust; but if the transfer of the legal title to the stock is made and accepted under an agreement of the stockholder which deprives him of all power to direct the trustee, and all opportunity to exercise his own judg- ment in respect to the management of the affairs of the corporation, then, whether the transaction is open to the 1804

			In Ohio it is held that it is legal for tile stockholders to deposit their stock with a depositary, to be transferred to such depositary and voted by him as directed by a committee of the stockholders, such committee being named, the object of the deposit being to effect an adjustmcnt of differences between the conmmon and prc- ferred stockholders;2 and in Alabanma that where, in order to pre- vent the foreclosure and sale of a railroad, a reorganization agree- ment is entered into by the creditors and stockholders, whereby the claims of the creditors and the voting power of the stockholl- ers are vested in trustees, the voting power to be exercised .by the trustees until certain debts were paid, the stockholders cannot withdraw from the agreement and claim the right to vote upon their stock.3 This decision was entirely correct, and in fact many of the voting trusts have been created as a part of the plans of re- organization of insolvent railroad systems.&#x0027; l Ryan v. McLane, 01 Md. 175 (1000). Where an agreement for the pooling and voting of stock provides that any holder of trustee&#x0027;s certificates may on six months&#x0027; notice demand from the trustee repayment of the price which he paid for the stock, such demand may be enforced by a suit and the money collected from the trustee. Waggaman v. Nutt, 88 Md. 265 (1808). 2 The agreement did not prevent any stockholder from demanding back his stock whenever he saw fit The court held that this was not a "voting trust." and that it was merely"a convenient method by which distant and widely- separated shareholders became enabled, indirectly, to participate in the control, and management of the company, and from which each could recede at any time and demand return of his stock without violating any term of the agreement. The depositary is a proxy required to vote the stock as directed by the committee." The contract of deposit is given in the report. The suit arose on quo warranto proceedings
			to oust the board of directors who were elected by the vote of the deposit- ary, but whose title tooffico was denied by the company. Ohio, etc. Co. v.

			VOTISO TRUSTS. Recent events In the financial world have given rise to a good deal of discussion about the nature and bearings of what is known as voting trusts in connection with the stocks of railroads and other corporations. The definition of the term is a delegation of the right to elect direct- ors and officers of such companies to certain 60 ,§ (o22f.]

			[02c2f. On the other hand, it has boon hold in Alabama that although many stockholders transfer their stock to a trustee to hold and vote for it three years, anti agree not to sell until they have offered to soll to each other, yet any one may soil to an outsider, ant( the latter may demand back his stock from the trustee.&#x0027;
			In Maine it is hold that a transfer of a controlling interest of stock of a railroad&#x0027; company to trustees to hold until tile road is completed, and then to return the same to the transforrors, the object being to secure the co-operation of municipalities in obtain- ing an extension of the charter and the granting of municipal aid, is legal, the transaction being a fair one, and being known to the public, and insisted upon by the public before aid would be given.2
			The federal court as early as 1867 held that an agreement by which various owners of stock place their stock in the hands of one person as trustee or agent to hold for a certain period of time, the parties agreeing not to sell their stocl; withoutlhaving first offerod to sell it to the rest of their associates at a price not above the then current market value, and, in case of their declin- ing to take it, without next offering it to the trustee, but any one of the parties to be at liberty to withdraw at any time on those terms, is not "contrary to public policy, or any wise open to ob- jection;"3 and there have been many recent decisions in the fed- eral courts on various "pooling" agreements.4&#x0027; ost of the decis- trustees, either for a specilled period or a length of time contingent upon other events, com- monly the payment of dividends on the stocks held In trust. Arrangements of this kind are the outcome for the most part of the railroad reorganizations which have been so frequent during the past decade. When modern and correct principles began to be applied to the reconstruction of bankrupt corporations, it was found that one of the primary requirements was that bankers and capitalists should provide very largo sums of money for the purpose of buying up claims against the company, for extinguish- ing the rights of non-assenting holders o stocks and bonds. and for the purchase of the equip- ment and completion of the Improvements needed to put the plants in condition for profit- able operation. The natural sequence of this was that the bankers orsyndicates who supplied the capital desired to retain the management of the company in their own hands for a certain length of time, so that they might have the as- suranco that their plans would be carried out by a management nominated by themselves and In sympathy with their views. In matters of that kind continuity of management and an absence of liability to sudden changes In the control or policy are very important. Consequently, In nearly all of the large railroad reorganizatlons,
			13
			like those of the Northern Pacific, Flo, oteading, and so forth, the plans tnder which the finances of the companies wore readlusted Included pro- visions by which the stocks of the reorganized road wore to be deposited with three or moro voting trustees, who would i.sue against the stock their certificates, carrying a beneficial in- terest to the holders of such certificates in the stocks so deposited. In most cases the voting trust was arranged to last for from three to live years, or until dividends had been paid on at least the preferred stock, either for a year or longer, at a specified rate. It was also gener- ally set forth that the voting trustees them- selves might terminate the voting trust of their own volition, and in at least two notable cases, those of the Northern Pacific and the Baltimore &#x0026; Ohio, the voting trustees did actually end their trusteeship and deliver the stock itself to the holders of the voting trustees&#x0027; certificates prior to the time when the arrangement would have been terminated. &#x0027; Moses v.

			ions on this subject, however, have boon in the state courts, and, as shown abovo, those decisions hanvo quit uniformly sustained this miodo of tying up for a tern of years the control of a majority Rop. 077 (1803), three stoclhdoldors, by an Instrulnolt similar to a bill of sale, sold their stock to a fourth stockholdor "for and during the period of six months, . , in trust for tie use and benofit of tho grantors," with power to soil the same on certain terns, yet the court hold that this instrument was not a milo or trust agreement, but merely a power ofattorney. It did not prevent the fourth stoukliolder from selling his own stock on suoh terms as le chose, oven though he did not sell the stocik of the others, it not appear- ing that the sale of his stock prevented his selling the stock of the others. The instrument convoyed merely at most "only a dry legal title for the mere purpose of sale, and with the power of sale carefully circumscribed." In the case of Ryan vt Seaboard &#x0026; R. R, R., 89 Fed. Rop. 397 (1808), there was involved a pooling agreement by which the signers agreed for five years, or until thirty days after the agreement should be abrogated, not to sell nor dis- pose of their stock nor to delegate the voting power thereof to any person other than three specified persons and without the written consent of three- fourths of the aggregate shares of the signers to the agreement, and the agree- ment also authorized these three per- sons to vote as proxy for all signers of the agreement who should not be per- sonally present at any meeting of the stockholders. The essential featuresof the agreement were that no stock- holder would sell his stock for five years except upon the consent of three- fourths of the stock in pool, and in the meantime he would vote in person or through specified proxies. One of the signers, after sending in his certificate indorsed in blank, sold the same to the complainant in this suit without de- livery of the certificate itself, such cer-
			tifinato having boon canceled and a new certillcnto issued to the ohairmlinn of the pooling committee. Tils suit was instituted to compel the delivery of the stock called for by such curtil. cato and sale and for other relief. The court hold that the suit would lie, but that all the parties signing the agree. mont were necessary parties defendant in this suit to detormino the validityof the agreement, excepting such of theor as had sold their stock. The court held also that the suit was not multifarious, although it joined the company as a party defendant in order to obtain a transfer of the stock. An injunction pendente liet against the voting of certain stock in connec- tion with the formation of an alleged illegal pool will not be continued where it failed to accomplish its purpose at one annual meeting and will fail at the next meeting. Ryan t. Seaboard &#x0026; R. B. R., 89 Fed.

A part of the subscribers did not pay, and til vendor of the prop- erty took tho trustee&#x0027;s certificates of suchl non-paying subsoribers, and on the death of the trustee a bill was filed to have the court substitute a new trustee and one of the subscribers filed a oross- bill for an accounting. Tile court de. creed a winding up of the syndicate and appointed a receiver. The court held that a partial payment made to the vendor of the stocks was legal, even though all the property was not conveyed to the trustee, as contem- plated, and that the vendor&#x0027;sacceptanpe of the certificates of non-paying sub- scribers obligated him to pay therefor, although such trustee&#x0027;s certificates had become worthless, the transaction being in connection with the Oregon Pacific Railroad Company. The court said that the syndicate was in substance, though not technically, a joint-stock company. 1 An agreement between stockholders holding a majority of the shares to pool their stock by transferring it to trus- tees, and authorizing them to vote all such stock at corporate meetings, and to pledge it as collateral for loans, is void, as against public policy. Hence the holder of one of the trubtee&#x0027;s cer- tificates may demand his stock and may enjoin the trustee from voting his stock or disposing of it. Iarvey v. Linville Imp. Co., 118 N.

PI. 1800). A pool of stool does not prevent a creditor of one of the partiol- pants causing to be sold on execution his debtor&#x0027;s interest in the stook, such sale to be subject to the pooling con. tract if it is lawful. Hardin v. White, etc. Co., 20 Wash. 583 (1001). Where one street railway company takes a lease of the street railways of three other companies on an agreement whereby the stock of the latter com- panies Is deposited with a trustee, and the lessee issues "stock trust certifi. cates" therefor, being its obligation to pay a fixed rate of interest per year, with an option on its part to pay the principal sum or not at Its option at a specified time, the stock being security therefor, to be sold by the trustee in case the principal and interest are not paid, this form of financing does not create a debt, and hence such certifi. cates are not subject to taxation as a bond and mortgage, the transaction being really a guaranteed dividend or rental. Commonwealth v. Union, etc. Co., 192 Pa. St. 507 (1899). &#x0027; Williams v. Montgomery, 148 N. Y. 519, 526 (1896), where the court said that under the New York statute the power of alienation is suspended only when there are no persons in being by whom an absolute title can be conveyed, and that " the test of alienability of real or personal property is that there are per- sons in being who can give a perfect title," and that "where there are living parties who have unitedly the entire right of ownership, the statute has no application," and that inasmuch as the agreement of several persons not to sell for a specified time may at any time be
			waived or canceled by unanimous con- sent, the statute does not apply. A trust deed is not void as suspending the power of alienation, inasmuch as by payment the mortgage may cease, or by agree- ment of all parties interested it may be canceled. Balfour.Guthrie, etc. Co. v. Woodworth, 124 Cal. 109 (1899). See to same effect, § 812, infra. sWilliams v. Montgomery, 148 N.Y. 610,520 (1890), where the agreement not to sell for six months was upheld, the court saying: "Nor was the agreement opposed to public policy, for a reason- able regulation as to the mode of sell- ing the stock, so as to prevent the sacri- fice thereof, was not a restraint upon trade. As an incident to the contract, making partition of the shares, it was competent for the parties to agree that the stock donated to the corporation, in which they had a common interest, should be first offered for sale. This was no restraint upon the business freedom of the parties, but a promotion of the general interest, by temporarily with- holding from the market shares owned by individuals in order to afforda rea- sonable opportunity to sell-shares indi- rectlyowned by all. The protection of the interests of all concerned, by pre- venting the market from suddenly be- coming overcrowded and ruinously de- pressed, was a reasonable, just, and honest purpose, which the law does not condemn. There was no evil tendency in the arrangement, as it simply pre- vented a course of action that would have brought loss both to the common and the personal interests."

			transaction. In other words, such a pooling of stock is not illegal in itself, but, like all contracts, may be illegal if actual fraud is in- volved.
			It remains to add that while the agreement of the holder of a trustee&#x0027;s certificate, like the agreement of a holder of a certificate of stock, not to sell the same during a specified time, is legal, just as the agroeemnt of a partner in a copartnership, not to sell his interest therein or dissolve the partnership for a term of years, is legal,&#x0027; nevertheless such contracts do not actually prevent a sale. A sale made in violation of such a contract is upheld by the courts, but the party making such a sale in violation of his contract is lia- ble in damages to the other parties.&#x0027;

			the Great Northern Railroad Company. Such also was tile plan of the United States Steel Corporation, which acquired the control of a largo number of competing stool manufacturing corporations. Ordinarily one corporation hias no charter power to purchase the stock of another corporation,&#x0027; but the statutes of most of the states now allow incorporation for any legal purpose, and lhenco it is possible to organize a corporation for the purpose of owning and holding the stock of other corporations. The advantage of this plan is that the absolute title to the stock passes, whereas, in a pooling or trustee agreement, the stock is to be returned to the par- ticipating parties, and tlere is always danger that one or more of the participating parties may at any time bring suit to recover back such stock. The objection to the plan, however, is that it enables the directors of the stockholding corporation to sell the stock at any time, and it involves not merely temporary pooling of the stock, but the permanent parting with the title. Another objection is that the stockholding corporation itself is liable to be attacked by the state, on the ground that it is an illegal combina- tion of competitors, in restraint of trade, and in violation of statutes prohibiting such combinations. Such was the result of the forma- tion of the Northern Securities Company).

Where an agent of a corporation purchases with corporate funds, without authority, stock in an- other company, and sells one of the shares to a person in order to enable the latter to qualify as a director in such company, the person receiving the one share is protected in his title, and the first-named corporation cannot compel him to give it up, even though the agent had no power to sell, the pur- chaser having purchased in good faith. Hence, his acts ns a director are valid. Scarlett v. Ward, 52 N. J. Eq. 197 (1893) Although the statute requires a di- rector to be a stockholder, it is no ob- jection that a qualification share was put in a director&#x0027;s name merely for the
			purpose of qualifying him. Re Leslie, 58 N. J. L 009 (1890). In a stockhold- er&#x0027;s suit to enjoin the corporation from entering into a consolidation, he can- not question the right of the directors to hold office on the ground that the qualification shares did not really be- long to them. Langan v. Francklyn, 20 N. Y. Supp. 404 (1892).&#x0027; Stock may be given to a person to qualify him as a director. Louisville, etc. Co. v. Kauf- man, 105 Ky. 181 (1898). Where four shares of stock are transferred to a per- son by the corporation to qualify him as a director, and he agrees to return the same to the corporation when ceas- ing to be a director, but thereafter, and bef;re he ceases to be a director, he agrees with the indorsers of his note that they shall have the stock as col- lateral security, they are protected, even though the stock was actually de- 1372

Ferrlis 42 Conn. 560 (1875) 2 A stockholder may have purclasud stock with . .lew of becoming a di. rector, or have obtained it by gift, or he may hold it upon a trust, and be qualified to be a director. He is quali- sied unless the "title was put in him colorably, with a view to qualify him to be a director for some dishonest pur- pose. in furtherance of some fraudulent scheme touching the organization or control of the company, or to carry into effect some fraudulent arrange- ment with thecompany." Re St. Law- rence Steamboat Co., 44 N. J. L 529 (1882). A person is qualified who buys stock in his own name with his wife&#x0027;s money and transfers the certificate to her, but afterwards, and before regis- try, keeps the stock for himself. Re St. Lawrence Steamboat Co., 44 N. J. L. 529 (1882). If the director has suffi- cient stock registered in his name, it is immaterial that he does not own it. Pulbrook v. Richmond, etc. Co., L. R 9 Ch. D. 610 (1878); Bainbridge v. Smith, 41 Ch. D. 462 (1889). &#x0027;State v. &#x0027;Smith, 15 Oreg. 08 (1887). The corporate books are not conclusive as to the qualification of a person to act as a director. If he own~ stock he is
			qualified, oven thougli he does not ap. pear as a stockholder on the corporate books, andi vice versa. The inspectors cannot reject votes on the ground that the candidate is not qualilled.

Horton v. Wilder, 48 Kan. 232 (1802). Where directors must be stockholders qualifier. to vote, a stockholder not qualified to vote by reason of not own- ing his stock for thirty days before the election is not qualified to be a director. Ilia election does not make him even a do facto director. Re Newcomb, 18 N.Y. Supp. 10 (1891). Where an election is " conceived in fraud and conducted con- trary to law," the call being insufficient, the notice concealed, the instigators having sold and transferred their cer- tificates of stock, the purpose of the election being to steal the control from one who really owned all the stock, and two of the alleged new directors not being stockholders as required by law, there are no directors de facto, even though they take possession and drive away the contractor who is building the road. Johnston v. Jones, 23 N. J. Eq. 210 (1872). In Barber&#x0027;s Case, L R 5 Ch. D. 903 (1877), arising under similar facts, the court said: "Mr. Barber was not qualified to be elected a director, and h is election was absolutely null and void. . . . If he had acted as a director, there might have been an estoppel."
			The board of directors cannot, even under a by-law authorizing thoin to fill vacancies, oust a director on tlh ground that he was ineligible when oleoted, and then proceed to fill his place. Commonwealth v. Dotwillor, 181 Pa. St. 014 (1800). A director who is not a stockholder cannot sign a statutory no- tice of a meeting to increase the capital stock. Re Wheeler, 2 Abb. Pr. (I. S.) 801 (1800). It formerly was hold in England that the election of one not a shareholder as a director in a corpora- tion in which it is required that the di- rectors be owners of a certain amount of stock is valid; and such a person, upon acceptance of the directorship, is bound to take and pay for the required number of shares. But the later de- cisions have established the rule that by accepting the directorship he does not thereby become liable as a sub- scriber for stock to the amount of quali- fication shares. See § 52, supra. The election of a disqualified person as di. rector is voidable, not void. People v. Albany, etc. R. R., 55 Barb. 844, 878 (1800). 1 See § 020, supra. 2Sohmidt v. Mitohell, 101 Ky. 576 (1897). SGreenough v. Alabama, eto. R. R., 64 Fed. Rep. 22(1894). Where directors must be stockholders, a person elected director without his knowledge and owning no stock, and who never acted as a director for ten years, is not a director, even though a share of stock was given to him shortly after his election and he took the same. Hence he may purchase corporation property at a judicial sale. Rozecrans Gold Min. Co v. Mory, 111 CaL 114 (1890). 1375 ull. xxxVI.]

			A statute requiring directors to be stockholders does not apply to directors named in the cortillcato of incorporation for the first year.&#x0027;
			Where a person not eligible to the office is deolared elected, and no stockholder objects or takes legal proceedings to test the right to tile ollice, and such person is allowed to perform the duties of his ollic, lie becomes an ollicer defacto. As such his acts cannot be objected to on the ground that he was not a legally-elected di- rector. Neither corporate creditors, nor the corporation, nor tlh stockholders, nor the director himself, are allowed to raise this ob- jection in that manner. The remedy is to oust him by quo war. r&#x0027;anto or to enjoin him as a usurper. But after ho is allowed to become a dJ farcto director, his title to oileeo annot be attacked collaterally, nor can his acts be repudiated on that ground.2 A director, as a dclfacto director, may bind the company by his acts, if allowed to continue in his position.&#x0027;

			New York statutes that "if a director should ceanso to bo a stock. holder his ollice shall become vacant" is solf-exocuting. Wheoro the charter requires directors to be stockholders, and three of the seven are clerks, to each of whom one share of stock is transferred, and the certificate thorefor is at once rotransforred to the real par- ties in interest, this is good ground for a forfoiture of tle charter.2 The director does not becomo disqualified by reason of his pledg- ing his stock.8 The secretary, treasurer, or other ofilocr of a corpo- ration need not be a stockholder or resident or citizen unless the statute requires it.&#x0027; "It is not uncommon for a single individual to hold several ollices in a corporation."

			preventing sorvioo being made upon him, yet such resignation is sulllcient.&#x0027;
			A director may resign by an oral statement to that ffooct, and his resignation may be accopted in the same manner by the presi- dent.2 But a mere statement of a director that he will have noth- ing more to do with the ofllco is not a sufficient resignation.3
			A resignation may be effectual oven though it is not accepted; but it has boon doubted whether all the directors can resign, theoroby leaving the corporation helpless.4
			A director whose resignation has been accepted cannot after- wards vote at a meeting as a director.&#x0027; The fact of the resigna- tion need not be published or made known to corporate creditors.G
			In England it has been held that the resignation of a director must be presented to a meeting of the stockholders in order to be effective, unless the by-laws allow the directors to accept it.

			talting of property from the owner for a time till the rents, issues, nnd prollts satisfy a demand. The judgment in such case does not dissolve the corporation.2 Sometimes the corporation, after pay- ing its debts, distributes its assets among its stockholders without any dissolution.*
			In many of the. states and in England thero are statutes regulat ing the dissolution of a corporation. These statutes generally specify what parties may bring suit for dissolution, on what grounds dissolution will be decreed, and what proceedings must be taken to obtain the decree. Such a statutory dissolution is hardly a voluntary dissolution, and yet it approaches that kind of dissolu- tion more nearly than any other.4 A bill filed by a stockholder. 1 (1899D Whore a corporation organ- ized to build a town and soil lot. finds that its plans are impossible, and it owes no debts and has been practi- cally abandoned by its stockholders, and the officers each year sell a little of the land to pay taxes, some of the stockholders, even though they are a minority, may file a bill to have the court wind up the affairs of the com- pany and distribute the proceeds, it being shown that there are a great number of stockholders scattered throughout the country, and that it is impossible to get a majority of them together. Noble v. Gadsden, eto. Co., 81 &#x0026; Rep. 856 (Ala. 1002). 1 Re Binghamton Gen. Eleo. Co., 148 N. Y. 261 (1894). A receiver will not be appointed for a benevolent society in a suit by a member charging that illegal expulsions hase been made and illegal elections held, even though the illegal officers are running the business; nor will a receiver be appointed, although the purpose of the company is imprac- ticable, the member bringing the suit having been a party thereto. Equity will not interfere, although the com- pany is wholly illegal and unauthor- ized The remedy is at law. Crombie v. Order of Solon, 157 Pa. St. 588 (1808). 2Proctor u Sidney, etc. Co., 8 N. Y. App. Div. 42 (1896). A collusive suit by officers for dissolution and the ap-

			See 6070-072, infra, and § 548, supra.
			Thus, in New York, elaborate pro- vision is made. The majority ct the dilaotors may apply for dissolution. See Code Civ. Pr., §§ 2419, etc. As also may a creditor or stockholder. Code Civ. Pro., §§ 1784, etc. Under the New York statute the court will order the dissolution of a corporation where a majority of the directors and stock- holders wish it, where the interests are discordant, and a dissolution will be beneficial.

In a stookholders&#x0027; suit to dissolve and wind up a corporation the books of the com- pany are not admissible as against them, being mere declarations in its favor. Matter of Dittman, 05 N. Y. App. Dlv. 848 (1001. It is legal for a person to contract with the direct- ors of an insurance company to pur- chase at least sixty-five per cent. of the stock of the company, the same offer being made to all the stockhold- ers, even though it is proposed to there- upon wind up the company. Garrett Co v. Morton, 05 N. Y. App. Div. 800(1001). In this case the lower court has held (85 N. Y. Misc. Rep. 10-1901) that under the New York statute it is illegal for an insurance company to transfer its busi- ness and liquidate its affairs without dissolution proceedings, in accordance with the statute, and hence the pur- chaser of the business cannot minim in a suit for false representations as to the oondition of the company. Under a statute authorizing the court to dis- solve any corporation on good cause shown, a minority stockholder may lile a bill to have the corporation dissolved for purchasing unnecessary real estate. Bixler v Summerfield, 62 N. E Rep. 849 (111. 1902) Where the minority stock- holders file a bill for the dissolution of a corporation the court may refuse to proceed unless the stockholders at large are brought in. McKleroy t,

Watkins v. Lawrenoo Nat. Bank, 51 Kan. 254 (1893). The voluntary dissolution of a company under the statute, but with- out ton days&#x0027; notice required by the statute, is not suoh a dissolution as to prevent creditors from attaching the property of the company as though no dissolution had been had.

Wilere the main purpose of a corporation is the furnishing of lodgings and refreshments at the queen&#x0027;s jubilee, a stockholder has the right to have the company dissolved after the jubilee, even though, under general clauses, the objects of the com- pany are to furnish lodgings and re- freshments generally, and even though the directors intend to continue the improper influence of any kind, or of favoritism to the majority stock- holder, who had appointed the direct- ors, a very different case would have been presented. If the complainants had also charged that the directors, their trustees, had not only committed a gross and flagrant breach of duty, but that the majority stockholder had in- stigated them to do it, a strong case, ap- parently, would have been made out, in which to hold the majority stook- holder liable for damage&#x0027;." 189m, ou.

			A stockholder cannot institute thl sulit; nor a corpornto creditor;2 nor can the municipal authorities by reason of a change of route by a railroad; 3 nor can a porson who is ovrolnharged on It turnpike bring suit to forfeit the company&#x0027;s charter.4 The secretary of state cannot forfeit a charter, oven though tho statuto prosoribos forfoit- ure for non-payment of taxes; but it is constitutional to provide by statute, as is tile case in New Jersey, that the charter and all corporate powers shall be void and cease upon the non-payment of taxes." A stockholder in a corporation cannot sustain a bill to have tile charter forfeited and the corporation wound up on the ground that it was formed to purchase and combine various competing lin- seed-oil mills for the purpose of forming a monopoly. The state alone can ask for such a forfeiture. Moreover, tie stockholder, by being a stockholder, is estopped from complaining, and is presumed to liave had knowledge of the facts from the time that he became a stockholder.7 Where a public corporation, vested with state property for public use, makes a lease of it whiclh is ultra irtes, a private person cannot sustain a suit to contest it; this can be done only by the Gtate or the corporation.8 INorth v.

			§ 033. Flofi.iliro for misitvse.r- -Acts 1(7&#x0027;ich7 conlstiittc a mis. I0r -Ultr V a vircs acts and(l usurlation of franc7liscs.- The law is clear that, if a corporation misuses its powers, the state may by a suit witl,&#x0027;raw the charter which it has given. Groat difficulty, lhowevcr, arises in determining what constitutes a misuser. A clear idea can be obtained only by a study of tho cases themselves.1 1 A corporation organized to manu- facture railway cars has no power to lay out a town around its works and build twenty-two hundred homes to lease to its employees, to build and run a hotel and saloon, and also a theatre, ai gas plant, a system of water.works and a brick plant, and to own and run a farm for supplies to sell, and for its employees, and to own stock in other corporations manufacturing and osll- ing oar iron and railroad spikes; but may erect an office building contain- ing more space than it requires at the time, and may purchase more real es- tate than it actually requires at the time, and may supply liquor, etc., to passengers on its cars, and may sell surplus steam power. The state may bring quo uwarranto proceedings to for- feit thl charter. It is no defense that the usurpations had continued for many years to tile knowledge of the state, or that a legislative committee had reported that the real estate was properly taxed, People v. Pullman&#x0027;s Palace Car Co., 175 111. 125 (1808). The state will, at the instance of the attor- ney-general, forfeit the charter of the corporation whose stockholders have entered into a " trust&#x0027; with the stock- holders of cumpetinj corporations, for the purpose of forming a monopoly in and raising the price of sugar. The &#x0027; trust" is not a joint-stock association. It is of the character of a trust estate. People v. North River Sugar Ref. Co., 121 N. Y. 582 (1800). Quo warranto lies against a corporation formed to pur- chase substantially all the distilleries in the country. Distilling, etc. Co. v. People, 156 I11. 448 (1895). The state may forfeit a charter for a failure of
			the officers to ilie the annual report and of the stockholders to pay in the cap- ital stock as required by statute, It is nilmaterlal that the state&#x0027;s actlon was induced by parties who were tihem selves responsible for the failure to comply with the statute. People v. Bus- falo, etc. Co., 181 N. Y. 140 (1892). It Is cause for forfeiture that some of the directors, all of whom were required to be stockholders, held but one share each, the certificates for which shares wore transferred back at once to the real parties in interest, thus leaving the directors disqualified; also that re- quired certificates had not been filed; also that annual elections had not been held; also that the corporation had dcne business ultra vires. But unless public interest so requires, the attorney- general should not bring suit at his own instance. Lorillard v. Clyde, 142 N. Y. 450 (1804). A water-works char- ter may be forfeited where it wilfully and persistently charges more for water than its charter specifies. State v. New Orleans. etc. Co., 81 S. Rep. 305 (La. 1901). See s. a, 185 U. S. 830. In the case of State v. Hogan, 163 Mo. 43 (1901), it was held that an option to buy a mine is not property for which stock may be issued, under the consti- tution and statutes of the state of Missouri, there being no proof that the person giving the option owned it. Hence where $00,000 of stock was is- sued for the option and for services in inspecting the mine, and $30,001 of the stock was turned back for treasury stock, the court held that the state might maintain a bill to forfeit the charter.

			In Ohio it has been hold that a statute giving to a court the power to forfeit the franchises of &#x0027;turnpike companies for being erenco to watered stock, qto tearrtnto lies where $1,000,000 of stock is issued for tho possibility of patents to bolthero- aftergranted. In suoh quo warraunto proceedings stookhollors need not be malo partieo State v. Wobb, 07 Ala. 111 (1803). Whoro a railroad leases its line in violation of a constitutional provis- ion prohibiting theconsollidaton of par- allel lines, it is subject to forfeiture. So also where it issues " watered stock " in violation of the constitution. State v. Atchison, etc, R. R., 24 Nob. 1.13 (1888). In tile case of State v. New Orleans, etc. Co.,51 La. Ann. 1827 (1809), the subscrib- ers to the stock of a debenture com. pany paid ninety-live per cent. of their subscription by borrowing that amount from the company on their notes, and thereupon full-paid stock was issued to then, although the statute prohibited the issue of stock until paid for. The state brought suit to set aside the char- ter and liquidate the company. The court held that under the constitution of Louisiana the incorporation was illegal. Tle court held also that the charter was illegal, in that the debent- ures issued were forfeited if deferred payments were not made, and that they provided for cancellation at fifty per cent. on the amount paid, and that they were redeemable in numerical order in six yearsand that it would be impossible for the company to pay them. The same conclusion was reached in State v. Louisiana, etc. Co., 51 LI. Anni. 1795 (1899). Where a corporation is author- ized to commence business only when $100,000 of stock has been subscribed, and it does commence business prior to such subscription being made, the state may file a bill to forfeit its charter. State v. Debenture, etc. Co., 51 La. Ann. 1874 (1800). In the case of State v. Port- age City, etc Co., 107 Wis. 441 (1900), the court stated that a contract be- tween a city and a water-works com-
			1398
			pany, giving to tle latter the right to use tile streets for its water pipes, wis a franchise, and that quo twarratlo would lie to forfeit such franchise for failure to supply water in accordantci with its terms. Where an unauthorized lease of coin. poting lines has boon made, the state may forfeit tle charter of the clssorc and cause a receiver of the charter to be appointed, and such proceedings will lie even six years after the lease Iha been made. Eel River R. u. Stlte, 135 Ind. 433 (1000). In quo wurrualtu against a turnpike company the burden of proof is on the company to prove its title, and deeds from other companies without seals and not acknowlodged as corporate deeds are insufficient. Lyons, etc. Co. v. People, 08 Pac. Rep. 275 (Colo. 1002). The charter of a plank. road company for failure to keep the road in repair was forfeited in the case of People v. Detroit, etc. Co., 00 N. W. Rep. 087 (Mich. 1902). For failure to keep a part of its road in repair. or to rebuild a burned bridge, or for aban- doning a part of its road, a plank-road company&#x0027;s charter may be forfeited. People v. Plainfield, etc. Co., 105 Mlicl. 9 (1893). The charter of a water-works company may be forfeited when, in vio- lation of its charter, it does not furnish pure water and does not increase its source of supply. It is no defense that the municipality had elected to take over the property as provided in the original ordinance, or that the munici- pality had the right to annul the con- tract between the municipality and the company. Capital City Water Co. v. State. 105 Ala. 400 (1894). To a qi)o uwarranto to forfeit a water-works char- ter because it failed to supply sufficient water, it is no answer that the com- pany had intended to enlarge, but had not done so because the city had de- clared its intention to exercise its op- § 033.]

			Frequently a corporation does acts which its charter does not authorize it to do, or which its charter or a statute expressly pro- hibits it from doing. The question then arises, What is the remedy of tile state? The right of a stockholder, or the corporation itself, or a person contracting with the corporation, to object to such acts is discussed elsewhere.&#x0027; But may the state object? Undoubt- edly it may. It scorns that tile state has four remedies. Its legis- lature may repeal tlhe charter of the corporation under tho reserved right of the state to repeal; 2 or tile state may institute a proceed- ing to forfeit the charter for misuser of powers; or such pro- ceeding may bo only to oust the corporation from the exercise of tile usurped powers; or, according to some authorities, a suit may bo commenced in equity for an injunction restraining tile corpo- ration from committing tile ultra vire neats.&#x0027; Taking up first the subject of quo warranto, it seems that the judgment in an ordinary qio wiarranto proceeding may be either a forfeiture of all the cor- porate franchises and of the charter, or may be a forfeiture only of the right to continue to do the illegal acts, and that it is within the discretion of the court to say which judgment shall be rendered.&#x0027; majority of Its stock is hoel, contrary to the statutes and constitution of the state, by another railroad company, the case may be removed to the federal court&#x0027;if the latter company is an in- strument of interstate commerce and purchased the stock for interstate com- merce purposes. It is also removable where the latter company claims that its charter existed before such consti- tution and statutes, and give it a right to own such stock. South Carolina v. Port Royal, etc. Ry., 56 Fed. Repl 333 (1893). 1 See Part IV, infra. 2 See §g 39, infra. 3 See 3 035, infra. 4State v. People&#x0027;s, etc. Assoc., 42 Ohio St. 579 (1885), where only a dis- continuance of the acts complained of was ordered; People v. Improvement Co., 103 Ill. 491 (1882), where a com- plete forfeiture of charter, etc., was decreed. See also People v. Utica Ins. Co., 15 Johns. 357 (1818), where an in- surance company had engaged in bank- ing contrary to statute A partial ouster does not seem to differ much from an injunction at the instance of
			the state. See § 035, infra. In State v. Building Assoc., 35 Ohio St. 258 (1879), the court said that wlere the corpora- tion is.guilty of an offense which by statute iB cause for forfeiture of its franchise as a corporation, the court will decree that forfeiture; but where the cause of forfeiture is outside of those prescribed in the statutes, then the court may decree either a forfeit- ure of the franchise to be a corporation or an ouster from the powers and acts illegally assumed or done. There may be a judgment of ouster of a particular franchise, and not of the whole char- ter. State v. Old Town Bridge Corp., 85 Me. 17 (1802). Where two compet- ing gas companies agree on rates to be charged the public and agree not to interfere with each others&#x0027; patrons, the state may forfeit their charters, or the court may in its discretion declare a forfeiture or ouster of the right of the defendants to carry out the illegal acts.

			Quo war/&#x0027;alto lies to forfeit tho exclusive feature of a franchise without forfeiting tile remainder of the franchise.&#x0027; It hns been hlol in a recent well considered case, that where a corporation is exercising a power wlhich it has no charter right to exorcise, a judgment may oust it from exercising that particular power, but where the corporation has been guilty of acts which by statute are mado the cause of forfeiture, the whole charter may bo forfeitcd.2 Tho nature of soire facias, quo warranto, and information in :lhe nature of a quo war&#x0027;ranto, is explained in the.notes below.&#x0027; edY the mischief. City of Ashland v. Ashland, etc. Co., 110 Wis. 04 (1901). The court may forfeit the charter of a railroad corporation for illegally lens. ing its road, and need not merely on. join the continuation of the lease. East Line, etc. I. t&#x0027;. State, 75 Tex. 434 (1889). " Corporate charters are not forfeited in fragmenits, or annulled as danages for the violation of private contracts." In condemnation proceed- ings the defendant cannot set up that the charter has been violated. Re Long Island R. ., 143 N. Y. 07 (189)4). In Pennsylvania, where the state filed an information to declare ultlr vires a contract between a canal company and a coal company, whereby one-half of the canal facilities were monopolized by the latter, the court held that an information was a proper remedy, and that the court, in its judgment in favor of the state, might order the corpora- tion to discontinue the unauthorized act, and that the judgment need not oust the corporation from its charter and franchises. Commonwealth t&#x0027;. Dela- ware, etc. Canal Co., 43 Pa. St. 205 (1862). Although the state proves the case, yet the court will not adjudge a forfeiture unless justice requires it. State v. Essex Bank, 8 Vt. 489 (1836). 1Commonwealth v. Sturtevaut, 182 Pa. St. 323 (1807). 2Marion Bond Co. v. Mexican, etc. Co., 05 N. E Rep. 748 (Ind. 1902). Where a railroad company has been adjudi- cated to have no power to own ware. houses it may lease them. State v.
			Now Orleans, etc. Co., 88 S. Rep. 81 (La. 1002). See 73 8. W. Rep. 045. 3 Professor Dwight explained these as follows: "Scire facias is resorted to where there is original defect in the charter, as if, c. g., a grant obtained by fraud. It may be used also in the case where the charter was valid but the powers of acorporation have been abused. The distinction taken in England is this: that a soire facias may be resorted to where a legal corporation in full posses- sion of its powers abuses thoem, while a quo twarranto is applicable where a cor- poration, from a defect in its constitu- tion, such as a loss of part of its meni- bers which are integral to its existence, becomes an imperfect body, but never- theless continues to act as a corpora- tion. See Grant on Corporations, 200. " Writ of quo warranto. This is an ancient writ, employed by the king against any one who claims or usurps an office or franchise, or who, having had a right to the franchise, neglects to exercise it, to inquire by what warrant he still claims to exercise it. The theory of the writ is, there is an unlawful en- eroachment upon the royal prerogative. and, being a dilatory proceeding and technical, it is not now so much em- ployed as the succeeding remedy. "Information in the nature of a quo warranto. This is in form a criminal proceeding. There were two proceed- ings in the criminal law for the convic- tion of criminals. One is termed an information and the other an indict- 1404

			Quo watranto at the instance or the state does not lie omroly becauseo street railway company has boon given stroot rights in perpetuity by a municipality, while the statute limits its corporiato existence to thirty years.&#x0027; In an action by the state to forfeit a railroad charter the state must prove not only that a cause of for- nment. They differ in this respect: that while an indictment is found by a grand jury, ani inforlmation is simply the ille- gation of an officer who files It. In this case the attorney-general proceeds on twofold ground, both to punish the usurpor and to prevent the unlawful exercise of its franchises. In the case of a corporation the main object is to interfere with the exercise of the franchise. Tlhe inquiry is the samo as in the writ of quo warantuto; that is, by what warrant the franchise is exer- rcised. The reason why it is more re- sorted to Is that it is easy and simple of application. "Under the New York code the pro. ceeding is simply an action brought by the attorney-general, governed by the same general rules as an action at com- mon law. If judgment goes against the corporation it is liable to be dis- solved. This proceeding in England was instituted in the great criminal court, the king&#x0027;s or queen&#x0027;s bench, and in New York in the supreme court only, which represents the queen&#x0027;s bench." A quo warranto is not such a criminal proceeding as to require the degree of certainty as is required in criminal pro- ceedings. Independent, etc. College v. People, 182 111. 274 (1899). In the case of State v. Merchahts&#x0027;, etc. Trust Co., 8 Humph. (Tenn.) 235 (1847), the court said: "By the common law the for- feiture of a charter can be enforced in a court of law only; and the proceeding to repeal it is by a scire facias or an information in the nature of a writ of quo warranto. A scire facias is the proper remedy where there is a legal existing body capable of acting, but which had been guilty of an abuse of the power intrusted to it; a quo war- ranto where there is a body corporate
			de facto, which takes upon itself to act as a body corporate, but from some de- sect In its constitution it cannot legally exercise the power it affects to use." Citing 8 Wheat. 488, 484. For teo ancient learning as to scire facias in forfeiting charters, see State v. MIoore, 10 Ala. 014 (1851). When tile informa- tion has for its object to oust the de- fendants from noting as a corporation, and to test the fact of their incorpora- tion, it must be filed against individuals. When the object is to effect a dissolu- tion of a corporation which has had an actual existence, or to oust such corpo- ration of some franchise which it has unlawfully exercised, the information must be filed against the corporation.

			ration may file an information in the nature of qulo owarr;anto against. the corporation.1 But at common law an information to forfeit a charter does not lie for wrongs to creditors and stockhollers. It lies only for ultra virces acts, wilful and continued, and relating to some franchise granted.2 Quo war;anlto lies against foreign cor- porations doing business illegally in tile state.&#x0027; The state by quo warranto may oust a railroad from discriminations in favor of oil shippeod in tank cars.&#x0027; An exemption from taxation is not a fran- chise. Ilence, quo warranto does not lie to oust the corporation from such exemption.&#x0027; Although quo warranto can be only for acts committed within five years in Ohio, yet it serves to oust a company from exercising a power which it has not exercised con- tinuously for twenty years."

Non-uscr as a causc for forf(oitture-lFoifecitulre for fail- stre to conisleto a railroad or eoterplriso.-Non-user of its franchise is a cause for forfeiture where a corporation is possessed not only of its franchise to be a corporation, but also other franchises, such as a right of way, which the public are interested in having kept in active use. Thus, where a charter required a street railway company to lay its tracks on certain streets, and the company did so &#x0027;on a part of such streets and then removed them, and for many years operated no cars thereon at all, the court hold that the char- ter might be forfeited at the instance of the state.8 Whore a street 1 Hartnett .

Tlh remedy in such a i las is not in cquity.l A street railway grant from the city nmay be forfeited at tho insntnoo of the state where tho com- pany runs but one car a day in order to hold tho franchiso. It may also be forfeited for failure to construct tho entire line within the time specilled by statute.&#x0027;
			It is good cause for forfeiture of a charter by judicial decree that a railroad company does not complete its road, or does not complete it within a prescribed time.3 And such a forfeiture at its rold. State v. Kingan, 01 Ind. 142 (1875); State v. Beck, 81 Ind. 501 (1882). No forfeiture is decreed because a rail- road comrpany discontinues passenger trains over a branch line which is run at a loss by reason of horse-car compe- tition. Commonwealth v. Fitchburg R. IL, 78 Mass. 180 (1858) The lessee of a railroad is a proper party defendant to a suit to forfeit franchises for non- user. People v. Albany, etc. I R., 77 N. Y. :32 (1870); State v. Minnesota Cent. Ry., 30 Minn. 240 (1880). An as. sigmnmut of all corporate assets to others. tlereby rendering the corpora- tion incapable of continuing business, is cause for forfeiture. State v. Real Estate Bank, 5 Ark. 595 (1843). A bank which ceases to do business and to file statements, and which makes improper loans to its directors, is liable to forfeit- ure of charter. State v. Seneca County Bank, 5 Ohio St. 171 (1850). It is not a non-user for a county-fair corporation to rent its grounds. Kent County Agr. Soc. u. Houseman, 81 Mich. 609 (1800). Where the statute prescribes that non- user for a year shall be cause for for-- feiture, a non-user for a few days is in- sufficient. People t. Atlantic, etc. R R, 125 N. Y. 513 (1891). A railroad which is leased to another company without statutory provisions to do so is subject to forfeiture at the instance of the state. State v. Atchison, etc. R R., 24 Neb. 143 (1888). As to a failure of a railroad corporation to complete its road, see § 038, infra. The abandon-
			mont of the right of way by the rail- road is no ground for an action of tres- pass by the former owner to recover it. Logan v. Vernon, etc. R. IL, 00 Ind. 352 (1883). See, on this subject, § 000, in- fra.
			I In this case the company had not run its cars for throe years. State v. East Fifth St. Ry., 140 Mo. 530 (1807). 2People v. Sutter St. Ry., 117 Cal. 00.1 (1807). holding also that the court may impose a tine instead of forfeiting the rights. 3 The failure of a railroad corporation to complete its line as laid down in the charter is ordinarily good cause for forfeiture of its charter, but the state may waive it. People v. Ulster, etc. R. R.. 128 N. Y. 240 (1801). See also New York, etc. R R. v. New York, N. H. etc. R. R., 52 Conn. 274, 284 (1884).

			the instanco of the stato, by rouson of tleo fniluro of the corpora- tion to complete its ontorpriso as required by charter, has often been dlcroeed. (Tenn. 1875) Where a railroad conm plny mortgagoe suchl part of its road as Is complleted, and tile mortgage is foreclosed, the purchasers are not bound to go on and complete the road. Failure on their part to complete It is no defenso to an acotion on a subscrip- tion. Chartiers Iy, v. Hodgens, 85 Pa. St. 501 (1877). Tile court will not for- feit tle municipal grant to a water. works company, even though the latter does not oxtenl its mains as required by the ohartor. Mandamtius is the proper retmedy. City of Topeka v. To- poka Water Co., 58 Kain. 810 (1807). Cf. 0931, infra. I People v. Kingston, etc. Turnp. Co., 23 Wend. 103 (1840), whlere the road was not constructed as required; Thompson v.

R, Co., 0 Mich. 285 (1801). for a case of the construction of a road in sections. And where the charter pre- scribes that a certain number of miles shall be completed within a certain time, but does not prescribe that the effect of non-compliance shall be a for- feiture, then the only way of forfeiting the charter is by a suit and a decree of a court. Hughes v. Northern Pac. Ry., 18 Fed. Rep. 100 (1883); Arthur v. Com- mercial Bank, 17 Miss. 394, 430 (1848) The fact that a corporation commences business in another state within a year suffices for a charter provision that it must commence business within a year.

			Ra Capital F. Ins. Co., L. I 21 Ol. D. 200 (1882); People v. Krnkaleoo Im. provement Co., 103 III. 401 (1882). ln this case the charter required the pro. posed improvements to be completed within eight years as far east as the state line. The company completed ns far east as Kanlkakeo City, and claimed the right to exercise tile option of mnlt. ing or not making further improve. ments between that point and the stiate line, Tllecourtsaid: "Thle non-compli- ance witlh the requirements was pe&#x0027; sc a misuser, and a cause of forfeiture of the franchise as for condition broken; " and "we can see here but one entire franclise for the improvement of these streams, and that this obligation to make the improvements above Kanka- keo City was a condition annexed to this entire franchise. . . . We think the non-compliance with the require- ment in question was a cause of for- feiture of the entire franchise." The bondholders of the company take the risk of this forfeiture of the charter for non-compliance with conditions. Silli- man v. Fredericksburg, etc. R. R, 27 Gratt. (Va.) 119 (187{), where, however, the corporate officers were endeavoring to enforce fraudulent bonds.

The remedy of the state is quo warranto.s In England, however, a bill has been sustained to restrain a railroad corporation from engaging in the coal business.&#x0027; And an injunction lies to enjoin a corporation, the same as an individual, from creat- ing a public nuisance.&#x0027; The state may enjoin a railroad corpora- tion from purchasing a competing line in violation of the constitu- tion.0 In Wisconsin it is held that the uttorney-general may enjoin suit is brought in the interest of rival corporations.

The extension of time to complete railroads applies so as to prevent forfeiture for non.coni- pletion within the original time. Stato v. Bergen Neck Ry., 53 N. J. L 108 (1800). Although suit is brought to forfeit a street-railway franchise for using electric power without author. ity, the legislature may cure the defect of power. To forfeit for not commenc- ing work within a year the pleading must allege when the work was com- menced. People v. Los Angeles. etc. Ry., 01 Cal. 338 (1891). An amendment to a charter is a waiver of any forfeit- ure thereof due to not commencing business within the prescribed time. Farnsworth r. Lime Rock, etc. R R. 83 Me. 440 (1801). Although the act re- quires the certificate of incorporation to specify the termini, and the certili- cate merely says the termini are in a certain city, yet if the legislature sub- sequently, by special act, recognizes the company, the legality of its existence cannot. bp questioned. Koch v. North Ave. Ry., 75 Md. 222 (1802). In this case the organization was under the general railroad law. Under such a
			charter the route and Its tormnini are to bu detterinlled by the lmalyor and city council &#x0027; under their genenrl power of control and regulation of tile streets" A statute authori.ing a corporation to redlce its capital stock waives infor- malities in its incorporation, and saclh waiver may extend to an illegal issue of watered stook. State v. Wobb, 110 Ala. 214 (1800). A waiver may be ex- press or by statutes recognizing its con- tinued existence, Ra New York El. R. R., 70 N.

But waiver as to ter- minus is not a waiver of an abandon- ment of part of tle road, nor of a defect as to the width of the turnpike. Peo- ple v. Fishkill, etc. Co., 27 Barb. 445 (1857).

With a few exceptions such an allegation is not allowed.
			A creditor of a supposed corporation cannot ordinarily hold the stockholders liable as partners although they did not legally incor- porato.3 It is true tilat in certain cases, wlhere a stockholder is nadol lial)l to corporate creditors upon the dissolution of the cor- poration, a dissolution is hold to exist where the corporation is expressly waive a cause for forfeiture arising from suspension of specie pay- nlents Atchafalaya Bank t: Dawson, 1:i La. 407 (1830).

The waiver pro- tects a turnpike corporation from an indictment for obstructing the road. State v. Godwinsville, etc. Co., 44 N. J. L. 400 (1882). But the waiver must have been clearly intended. People v. Kingston, etc Co., 23 Wend. 103 (1840). The appointment of a corporate officer by the governor and senate is not a waiver. People v.- Ploenix Bank, 24 Wend. 431 (1840).

Thus, a stockholder sued on his subscription cannot, unless his sub. scription was made previous to the incorporation, sot up that the company was not legally incorporated."
			The corporation is called a de,/ cto corporation, and only the state is allowed to question its existence.
			If there is a law authorizing incorporation, andt a company has attempted to organize under it and has acted as a corporation, it &#x0027; See § 631, supra. 2 Re Brooklyn, etc. Ry., 72 N. Y. 245 (1878); Re New York Cablo Co. v. IMayor, etc., 104 N. Y. 1 (1887). In con- domnation proceedings the incorpora- tion may be attacked as not being de facto. Its tic jure existence cannot be so attacked. Brown v. Calumet River Ry., 125 Ill. G00 (1888). In condemna- tiou proceedings the defense that the corporation has ceased to exist for fail- ure to complete its road within ten years is not good, inasmuch as the cor- porate existence can be attacked only in a direct proceeding for that purpose. Morrison v. Forman, 177 III. 427 (1808). A railroad company regularly organ- ized is entitled to condemn a right of way, even though it was organized in the interest of a coal company which furnished the capital for such railroad. The claim that the railroad company is merely a dummy for the coal company is no defense to the condemnation pro- ceedings. Kansas, etc. Ry. tv North- western, etc. Co., 101 o. 288 (1901). An adjacent owner cannot enjoin a street- railway company on the ground that its charter is invalid, unless his prop- erty rights areaffected. Nicbols v. Ann Arbor, etc. Ry., 87 Mich. 301 (1891). A person whose land a corporation seeks

			to tale under power of eminent do- main cannot set up that the articles of incorporation had not been filed with the secretary of state, as required by the incorporating statute. Portland, etc Co. v. Bobb, 88 Ky. 220 (1889). A railroad charter is not good so far as the right to condemn land is concerned, where the terminus is stated to be on the state line in a certain county. At- lantic, etc. R R. v. Sullivant. 5 Ohio St. 270 (1855). In condemnation proceed- ings the defendant cannot set up that tlecharter bas been violated. Re Long Island R R, 143 N. Y. 07 (1894). The existence of a railroad corporation can- not be questioned in an action brought by it to condemn land. Wellington, etc. . R. v. Cashie, etc. Co., 114 N. C. 090(1894). Where agas company opens the streets under a statute and pays damages, and partly lays its pipes, it cannot subsequently be enjoined by a property owner on the ground that the statute has subsequently been adjudged to he unconstitutional.

Toledo. eto, It. R. . Continental Trust Co., 9, Fed. oItep. 497, 508 (1899). In proving a de facto corporation the meet- ings and the issue of stock and tile transaction of business niny be proved by parol without producing the books. Jolnson v. Okerstrom, 70 Minn. 303 (1897). A de facto corporation exists where the company might have incorpo- rated under the statutes and has acted asacorporation. Methodist, etc. Cllrch v. Pickett, 19 N. Y. 482 (1859). Estoppel as to corporate existence seems to mean that the corporation is obliged to prove only a de facto existence, anid need not prove the details of incorporation. Leonardsville Bank c. Willard, 25 N. Y. 574 (18y2). &#x0027; Tle validity of the incorporation of an insurance company cannot be ques- tioned by a person who has given to it a capital-stock note.

Nor its suit on a note by tlh plea that it has abandoned its franchises. John v. Farmers&#x0027;, etc. Bank, 2 Bllckf. 1307 (1830); East Ten- nessee, etc. Co. v. Gaskell, 2 Lea (Tenn.), 742 (1879); Hartsvillo University v. Hamilton, 34 Ind. 500 (1870).

			DISSOLUTION, 1ORIIITURE, IBTO. Thus a corporation which files its certificate of incorporation with the secretary of state, but not with the county cleric, as required by statute, and transacts no business except to authorize the issue of stock for property, which issue is never made, is not even a de.facto corporation, and hence the directors are not liable for failing to lile a report as required by statute.l And where the statute author- izes incorporation for producing arid selling electricity, and the cer- tificate of incorporation includes this as well as manufacturing and selling electrical appliances, apparatus, and supplies, the corporation is not a dos jure corporation, and hence is insufficient to support an action by onepromoter against another, on a contract of the latter to convey land to a corporation to be formed and to take stock in payment, especially where the full capital stock of such corporation had not been subscribed for." The more fact that, a person con- tracts with a party and designates the latter as a "company" will not estop the former from denying the incorporation of the latter. This is the law, and is reasonable, since many copartnerships do business and make contracts under the name of "company." But where the party contracted with is a de facto corporation, then the rules given above apply. It is to be borne in mind, also, that a company which is supposed to be incorporated, but is not, may after incorporation ratify and enforce contracts made in its behalf.4 The execution and delivery of an instrument to a corporation as a corporation raises a presumption that the company was regularly incorporated."
			Irregularities in the organization of a corporation created by a state will not be inquired into in the courts of another state, a law. And such organization must be stock before incorporation may defeat in good faith." Hence, where an at- municipal bonds which are given to it. torney sues for his services, the sup- Farnham v. Benedict, 107 N.Y. 159(1887) posed corporation may set up that it is l Emery v. De Peyster, 77 N. Y. App. not a ce facto nor de jure corporation. Div. 05 (1002). An older New York case Welch v.

In a condemnation proceeding by a street railway to obtain a right over a turn- pike, the turnpike company may set up that the street railway charter has lapsed by reason of the company not having organized and commenced busi- ness within a certain time and that thereby the charter became void by reason of a constitutional provision. In re Philadelphia &#x0026; 31. Ry., 187 Pa. St. 123 (1808).

			But this drastic and dangerous construction of charters does not commendl itself to law and justice. It udds one moro to tie perils which are attached to all great corporate enterprises. Even in New York, whero the above doctrine seems to have had its origin, til courts are inclined to limit its application. The Now York courts have heldl tliat a provision in a chartor, that unless certain things are (lone within a certain timo the company should " forfeit the rights ncqluircd," ldos not vork a forfeiture ipso fact,&#x0027; and that a provision in a charter, that unless work shall be commenced witlin two years "all rights an(l privileges granted hereby shall be null and void,&#x0027;" is not self-executing, and a judgment of the court is necessary before forfeiture takes placeO and the weight of the corporation never came into exist. once, and an abutting property owner may onjoin tih laying of tracks.

Morrison v, Forman, 177 III. 427 (1808). The question of whether or not a charter has been forfeited by a provision that its rights should rovert to the state, in case certain work was not done within two years, cannot be raised by a party litigating withl such company, but can be raised only by a proceeding instituted by the state. Oly. pliant, etc. Co. t: Borough of Olyphlat, 100 Pa. St. 553 (1000). A statutory pro- vision tllat a corporation, for purposes of enforcing the stockholder&#x0027;s statutory liability, shall be deemed dissolved one year after it ceases to do business does not cause such dissolution as to pre- vent the corporation being sued there- after. Whitman t. Citizens&#x0027; Bankl, 110 Fed. Rep. 503 (1001). A provision that a railroad charter shall be null and void unless certain things are done within two years is not self-executing. Brown v. Wyandotte, etc. Ry., 08 Ark. 134 (1000). Even though a city has re- served the power to forfeit the right of a street railway company to construct its road on certain streets, if such con- struction is not completed within five years, this in itself does not work a for- feiture. but a forfeiture must first be declared. Louisville, etc R R. v. Bowl- ing Green Ry., 63 S. W. Rep. 4 (Ky. 1900). Altlough a municipal grant to construct a street railway provides that it shall be forfeited and the rights shall cease without any action at law or otherwise unless the road is completed within a specified time, yet the court will not&#x0027;enforce the provision if there was a legal excuse for the delay or a waiver of the provision. Dusenberry v. New York, etc. Co., 40 N. Y. App.
			Div. 207 (1800). A provision in a street railway charter tlhat, if certain tlhings are not done within a certain time, the "act of Incorporation lsall be void" as to streets not then covered, is not self-oxecuting, and delay in ilnlisting tloroon will constitute a waiver. Dorn v. Salt Lake, etc R. RI, 10 Utalh, 40 (1800). The act of congress granting lands to railroad comipanies, indl pro- viding that if any section of the roiad is not completed within five years after its location the land grant shall be for- feited, is not solf executing, and no for- feiture takes place except by judicial proceedings or an act of congress as- sumlling title. Utah, etc. IL I v. Utah, etc. Ry., 110 Fed. Rep. 870 (1001). Al. though the charter states that it shlll be forfeited unless the corporation is organized within two years, yet a stock- hohler cannot set up such a forfeiture in a suit involving a lien of the corpo- ration on his stool;. Boyd v. Redd, 120 N. C. 835 (1807). Where land has been condemned by a railroad corporation, the grantee of the party whose land has been so condemned, the grant hav- ing been made prior to the condemna- tion, but the grantee being represented in the proceedings, cannot maintain ejectment therefor on the ground that the railroad charter provided &#x0027; that the rights, privileges, and powers of said corporation siall be null and void," un- less certain work was done within a certain time, even if tlhe work had not been done within the prescribed time. Only the state can question the corpo- rate existence on this ground. New York &#x0026; N. E. R. I. v. New York, N. H. etc. R. R, 52 Conn. 274, 284 (1884). See also Briggs v. Cape Cod Land Co., 137 Mass. 71 (1884).

Where a bank cllrtcr pro- vided that it should be void unless the company should organize and proceed to business within two years, and the company organ- iz.ed, but failed to transact any business for fifteen years, a judg- iment of ouster against it will not be disturbed.4 The failure of a street railway company to perform a condition of its charter may enable a city to make a now grant to anotlier company.0

The repeal by the state of a charter before the expiration of the tile it was to exist, or the repeal at any time where the charter is perpetual, is an unconstitutional breach of the contract between the state and the corporation and the stockholders.6 Wlhore, how- among others for the payment of dam. ages for taking land, and the corpora- tion did not deposit the $200,000 in cash, but in bonds of the United States of the par value of $200,000, and of the mar. ket value of $230,000.

Also held that the ques- tion whether a corporation has ceased to exist for non-compliance with char- ter provisions could only be judicially determined in a suit to which the com- monwealth was a party. The corpora- tion itself, when sued for taxes, cannot set up this defense. Baltimore, etc. R. R. v. Marshall Co., 3 W. Va. 319 (1869!.

			It was formerly believed to be the conmmon law that upon the dissolution of a corporation all its assets belonged to the state, and all its debts were canceled, and that the creditors were not entitled to anything from the assets. This remarkable theory has been stated and restated in text-books and decisions of the courts for over one hundred years.3 It is found in Blackstono&#x0027;s Commentaries and in the old works of Kyd on Corporations and Grant on Corporations. The courts, however, while upholding the rule theoretically, have quite uniformly refused to alply such a doctrine, and have invented various theories, fictions, and argu- ments for avoiding this supposed doctrine of the common law.

Where the stockholders have dissolved a corporation by resolution, under the&#x0027; West Virginia statute, the court will not interfere and appoint a re- ceiver, unless it is shown that provision has not been made for payment of the debts.. Mere cessation of business is not dissolution. Law v. Rich, 47 W. Va 634 (1900). A corporation cannot appeal from a decree appointing a re- ceiver of it, where the same decree dis- solves the corporation, and no appeal is taken from that portion of the decree. State v.

			law.1 The stockholders may insist on the application of the statute of limitations as far as it is a bar to the claim of corporate creditors upon the assets.2 The statute of limitations does not run as against the estate of a dissolved corporation.&#x0027; Where the corporation has boen dissolved, and its assets distributed, and its trustees discharged by a decree of court, a creditor who was a party to the suit cannot afterward maintain a bill against the trustees to reach un- paid subscriptions.4 But often by statute, if the directors upon tile dissolution of a corporation distribute the assets among the stock- holders without paying the debts, they are personally liable for such debts.6 The mode of distribution among corporate creditors, where some have other security and others not, is considered else- where.0 The rights of the stockholders in the assets upon a dissolu. appointed at the instance of a creditor or stockholder. Havemoyer v.

A solvent corporation does not hold its property in trust for its creditors, even though it is in process of liquidation, and hence a partial distribution of the assets of a bank to the stockholders during liquidation, when the bank was solvent and retained what seemed to be sufficient assets to pay its liabilities, cannot be recovered back subsequently by the receiver in an action at law, al- though it turned out that the remain- ing assets were not sufficient to pay all liabilities, no bad faith being involved.

Upon dissolution the court may and will call in unpaid subscriptions where this is necessary in order to make a proper distribution. Rc Shopp:rd&#x0027;s, etc. Co., 70 L T. liep. 3(1803). In Re Anglo, etc. of W. A., [1898] 1 Cli. 327, the court ordered a call as a matter of form on subscriptions, so as to equalize the amount already paid on such subscrip- tions with a view to distribution on dis- solution. The assets, after paying the debts, are distributed in proportion as the stockholders have paid in theirsub- scriptions. Connecticut, etc. Co. r. Dunscomb, 00 S W. Rep. 345 (Tenn. 1002). 4 Re Drifileld Gas L Co., [1808] 1 Ch. 451. Where the original stock is paid for in cash at par, and then increased stock is paid for at the rate of 83 on $10, and upon the winding up of the company a large surplus exists for dis- tribution, the court ordered that the original stock should first receive $7 on each $10, and then that the remaining assets should be distributed pro rata on all the stock. Re Weymouth, etc. Co., [1891] 1 Ch. 60. Where there is a surplus remaining after paying back all that the stockholders have paid in, the common-law rule is that such sur- plus is divided pro rata among the stockholders, even though some of the stock had been paid up and other stock only partially paid up. This rule may

Re Mutoscope, etc. Syndicate, Ltd., [1809J 1 Ch. 89U. On a dissolution and winding up, where part of the stock is paid up and part not, each class of stockholders is repaid the amount paid upon that class of stock, and then the surplus is livided proportionately. Re WakeHeld, etce Co., [1802] 8 Ch. 103. On a winding up, if it turns out that the profits had been systematically overestimated for many years, thereby depriving common stock- holders of the dividends, an account should be taken and such dividends be then paid. Re Bridgewater, etc. Co., [1801] 2 Cb. 317. Founders&#x0027; shares are a species of preferred or deferred stock; and where, on dissolution, the found- ers&#x0027; shares are to have one-fifth of the surplus assets, the words "surplus as- sets" were construed to be the assets remaining after paying the debts, and also paying back whatever the stock- holders had originally paid in. Re New Transvaal Co., [1890] 2 Ch. 750. Even though there are different.classes of stock, a reduction of the capital may be made on a different basis from the basis specified as applicable upon a dis- solution and winding up.

			Debts due from the stockholder to the corporation are to be de- ducted from his interest in the assets.&#x0027; And an assignment or trans. for of stock by a stockholder after the dissolution of the corpora- tion is merely.an equitable assignment of his interest in the assets of the concern as it may appear upon the settlement.0 Where prof- its have been earned and properly entered as profits on the corpo- ration books they belong to the stockholder, even though there- after the corporation becomes insolvent and is wound up before will first be repaid out of the surplus assets In re Hulitt, 06 Fed.

On a foreclosure sale the court may order a distribution of any surplus remaining after the payment of the mortgage debt, and the court need not turn over such surplus to the insolvent corpora- lion, but may decree that the surplus be divided among the stockholders after paying all general creditors who present their claims within a fixed time.

			A person who convoys property to the corporation in payment for stock may contract that upon dissolution he shall receive back that property.&#x0027; A suit cannot be instituted in the name of a dis- solved corporation, inasmuch as it is dead, but by statute it is often provided that such suits may be brought for purposes of liquidl- tion.&#x0027; Where the corporation is dissolved, but by statute suits may be brought during the three succeeding years, a stockholder must request the directors to sue before he sues to compel a creditor to restore property illegally taken.&#x0027; A forfeiture of a charter by a state court does not affect the status of a receiver appointed by the United States court. Such receiver may proceed to administer the property.5

Where one of the or- ganizers of the corporation, who is also its president, sells goods to it for stock, the corporation is protected in its title, even though it turns out that he held part of the goods to sell on commission, but if he retains the stock and the com- pany is dissolved, it is bound to respect the rights of the owner of the goods in distributing its assets Wyeth v. Renz- Bowles Co., 66 S. W. Rep. 825 (Ky. 1002). 3 Under the Nebraska statute a dis- solved corporation may bring suit. Schmidt, etc. Co. v. Mahoney, 00 Neb. 20 (1900).

Ham v. Banque Ville Marie, 22 R. L 248 (100). In the case of Singer, etc. Co. v. Hutchinson, 170 IlL 48 (1898), the court held that the expiration of the two years prescribed by statute for a dissolved corporation bringing suits, etc., does not bar a writ
			of error sued out after the two years. Where by statute upon dissolution the directors are made trustees to wind up the affairs of the company, they may maintain a suit in another state, inas- much as they are not receivers, but are successors of the corporation.

			according to an executory contract, ceases upon such corporation passing into the hands of a receiver, where the receivership was accompanied by the usual injunction against the further transac- tion of business by the insolvent corporation. This conclusion is arrived at on the theory that the failure to perform was due to the operation of law, and hence that no damages could be recovered for breach of the contract.&#x0027; The better rule, however, is that even at common,law the obligations of a corporation do not cease by reason of its dissolution.&#x0027; The dissolution of a company does not put an end to its executory contract to employ a person,&#x0027; nor obli- I Malcomson v.

Eq. 18 (1800). "Where an insolvent corporation is forced into liquidation and dissolution, all its executory con. tracts perish with it, for this is an im- plied condition of their execution." The rule is otherwise as to a solvent corporation. "A receiver is not bound to carry out executory contracts of the corporation, but he may disregard them." No damages can be recovered for failure of the insolvent corporation or receiver to carry out the contract. Griffith v. Blackwater, etc. Co., 40 W. Va. 50 (1899). In the case of Liverpool, etc. Co .

Under the New Hamp- shire statutes, when a corporation is wound up under insolvency proceed- ings, all claims are allowed as of the same date, interest being added for those past due, and a rebate of interest made on those not yet due.

			Where a corporation is dissolved before a lease taken by it runs out, the lessor may hold its assets liable for the broach of contract.2 Where a receiver is appointed he generally finds a number of ex- ecutory contracts in force - contracts of employment, or for rental of promises, or for purchases of material, etc. He then must de- cide whether he wishes to adopt any of those contracts as his own. If he does not adopt a particular contract, then that contractor has no preferred claim against the receiver, as a part of the receiv- er&#x0027;s expenses or disbursements, but has merely a claim against the corporation and its general assets, and this claim may be for past sums due or for breach of contract, or both. On the other hand, if the receiver does adopt the contract, then as to sums becoming due before such adoption the contractor is a general creditor only, but as to sums becoming due after such adoption, they are a part of the receiver&#x0027;s expenses or disbursements and must be paid as such. The law is clear that a receiver may refuse to carry out an executory contract of the corporation. A receiver has no power, however, to cancel a lease except as to his own liability. The lia- bility of the insolvent corporation itself on rent accruing after the receiver is appointed is not affected by the insolvency and receiv- ership.3 A lessor, as a general creditor, may file a claim for rent to become due in the future under the lease.&#x0027; After a receiver is appointed interest ceases as between the creditors, but continues as against the corporation and its stockholders." In distribution, debts not yet due participate with a rebate of interest for the un- expired time.&#x0027; The liability of the corporation on indorsements is not considered in the distribution of assets by the receiver, except X See § 641, supra, 913, infra. &#x0027;Kalkloff v.

The rights and remedies of the creditors in such a case are fully considered elsewhere.0 So also it frequently becomes important to know whether a consoli- dated company is liable for the debts of the constituent compa. nies,7 and whether a purchaser at a foreclosure sale is liable for the debts of the foreclosed corporation.8

That is an option as- forded to creditors by the court, in view of the contract relations of the

			Suit does not lie against a corporation which has been dissolved.t But the statutes often contain a provision that the corporate exist- once shall be continued for a fixed time, pending the proceedings for dissolution, so that suits may be brought by and against the corporation for the purpose of closing the business and disposing of the assets.2 (1001) An action against a corporation may be continued against those who administor its assets where the corpo- ration is dissolved pending the suit.

			A. TIlE OCOASION, SCOl&#x0027;i, AND PUIPOBSB OR TIlE SUIIJEOTa HnEEIN. § 043. Tho cause and occasion of this subject.- Perhaps the most striking feature of the modern era of industrial development is the growth, wealth, and power of corporations. They have built the railways, dug the canals, established the factories, carried the ocean commerce, and assumed control of the industries of Europe as well as of America. They have absorbed a large part of the surplus wealth of the world, and have been the means of making groat profits. But these gains and profits have notalways been honestly preserved and administered for the benefit of those who are en- titled thereto-the stockholders of the company. Corporations, with their vast capital stock and their great income, have proved to be a temptation to corporate oliicers. These companies have been found to be efficient instruments of fraud and illegal gain. Corporations have become insolvent, and stockholders have lost their investments, while individuals have become millionaires.
			The expense, difficulty, and delays of litigation; the power and wealth of tie guilty parties; the secrecy and skill of their meth- ods; and the fact that the results of oven a successful suit belong to the corporation, and not to the stockholders who sue, all tend to discourage the stockholders, and to encourage and protect the guilty parties.
			In England, ever since the year 1720, when the "South Sea Bubble " exploded and unsettled the finances of the kingdom, there have been many instances of "bubble companies" and dishonest promoters.
			In America the cases involving a breach of trust by the directors arise generally out of the management of corporations, and not in their formation.
			It is the purpose of this part of this work to explain, so far as is possible, the methods of those frauds, and to point out the remedy for the wrong.
			§ 644. The three classes of stockholders&#x0027; wrongs herein - The cor- poration is ordinarily the party to remedy these wrongs.- Stock- holders&#x0027; wrongs, arising from a breach of trust by directors or a majority of the stockholders or third persons, are clearly divisible into three classes. They are: first, fraudulent acts;&#x0027; second, ultra vires acts;2 third, negligence of corporate directors.3
			There is another class of grievances -- that of internal dissen- sions in the corporation and dissatisfaction with its- policy and acts. These, however, are intra vires of the directors or majority of the IThis is the subject of this chapter. &#x0027;See ch. XLII, infra. 2 See ch. XL, infra.

		<ocrText>
			stockholders. The law gives no remedy for such dissensions, since the stockholder has the corporate elections as a remedy. &#x0027; The ma- jority are to rule so long as they do so without fraud and within the powers of the corporation.&#x0027; So also the decision of the board of directors is binding as regards the usual suits which a corpora- tion might bring against third persons.2
			It is to be borne in mind that frauds, ultra virce acts, and acts of negligence are injuries to the corporation; and the corporation is naturally the party to bring suit to rectify them. These frauds, ultra cvrcs acts, and negligence of directors do not affect the stockholder directly; but they affect the stockholders indirectly by decreasing the corporate assets, and thereby affectinthehe value of the stock. Ac- cordingly it is the duty of the corporation to bring suit to -emedy these wrongs, just as it is the duty and right of the corporation to bring suit to remedy an ordinary trespass, conversion, or fraud, whereby third parties injure the corporate property and interests. &#x0027;lhat a corporation may bring suit to remedy the frauds, ultra vires acts, or negligence of its trustees or directors was the decision of Lord Chancellor lIardwicke, in 1742, in the case of The Charitable Corporation against Sutton.3
			§ 645. But, the corporation failil!n to do so, a stockiholdcr malt bring the action.- Notwithstanding this fact, however, that it was the duty and right of the corporation to bring suit to remedy these wrongs, it gradually became apparent that frequently the corpora- tion was helpless and unable to institute the suit. It was found, where the guilty parties themselves controlled the directors and also a majority of the stock, that the corporation was in their power, was unable to institute suit, and that the minority of the stockholders were being defrauded of their rights and were without remedy; and it became apparent that there was a wrong which had no remedy. The time came when the minority of the stock- holders of a defrauded corporatipn--the corporation itself being controlled by the guilty parties- were given a standing in court for the purpose of taking up the cause of the corporation, and, in its name and stead, of bringing the guilty parties to an account. Accordingly, in 1843, in the leading case of Soss v. Harbottle,&#x0027; a stockholder brought suit in the name of himself and other defrauded stockholders, and for the benefit of the corporation, against the directors, for a breach of their duty to the corporation. This case was decided against the complaining stockholders on the ground 1 See ch. XLI, infra. every breach of trust, let the person be 2 See § 750, infra. guilty of it either in a private or public 32 Atk. 400. In this case the court capacity." As to the power of the state said: - Nor vill I ever determine that to remedy such abuses, see § 085, supra. a court of equity cannot lay hold of 4 2 Hare, 401.

			tlhat tho complainant had not proved that the corporation itself was undor tho control of the guilty parties, and had not proved that it was unable to institute the suit. The court, however, broadly inti. mated tlat a ease niiglt arise when a suit instituted by the defrauded stockholders would be entertainod by tho court and redress given. Acting upon this suggestion, and impelled by tile utter inadequacy of suits instituted by the corporation, do. frauded stockholders continue to institute these suits and to urge the courts of equity to grant relief. Tlleso efforts were unsuccess- ful in clearly establishing the rights of stockholders herein until the cases of Atwool against Merryweathor, in England, in 1867,2 and of Dodge v. Woolsey, in this country, in 1855.&#x0027; These two great and leading cases have firmly established the law for both England and America, that where corporate directors have con. mitted a breach of trust either by their frauds, ultra vires acts, or negligence, and the corporation is unable or unwilling to institute suit to remedy the wrong, a single stockholder may institute that suit, suing on behalf of himself and other stockholders and for the benefit of the corporation, to bring about a redress of the wrong done directly to the corporation and indirectly to all the stockholders.4
			The rule as formulated therein has been repeated, applied, ex- plained, and extended by subsequent cases and by text books until a system of jurisprudence may be said to be based upon it. In bringing that class of suits stockholders are notliable for libel and slander by reason of allegations in their suit against directors for fraud. Not even a director who was not a party can sue them for l lozley ts Alston. 1 PhiL Ch. 700 (1847), where the court said there was no reason assigned " why the corpora- tion does not put itself in motion to seek a remedy; " Lord v. Copper Min- ers, 2 Phil. Ch. 740 (1848). where the court refused relief because the acts were capableof confirmation and had been confirmed by the majority; Gray v. Lewis, L R 8 Ch. App. 1035, 1050 (1873). See also MnoDougall v. Gard- iner, L R 1 Ch. D. 18 (1875), in regard to the principle of law decided by these cases. 2L B.5 Eq. 464, . 518 How. 881. The case of Hawes v. Oakland, 104 U. S. 450 (1881), is perhaps of even greater importance than Dodge v. Woolsey, and may take the place of the latter. See also Dickerman tv
			Northern T. Co., 170 U. S. 181, 188 (1900), where the above section is cited. 4 It is to be noticed that long prior to these cases it had been held by the courts in various cases that a stockhold. er&#x0027;s action herein would lie, but the principle was not clearly established until the foregoing decisions were maae. Thus, in New York, as early as 1832, in the case of Robinson v. Smith, 8 Paige, 222 (1832), the remedy was de- clared to exist. In the early case of Preston v. Grand Collier Dock Co.. 11 Sim. 827 (1840), a bill by a stockholder in behalf of himself and others to ren- der certain persons liable as stookhold- ers, they having subscribed in order to get a charter, and then declared that they subscribed as trustees for the cor- poration, was sustained. 153 § 045.j

Nor (loes a suit by a stockholder against the corporation for an injunction and a receiver on the ground that tho corporation is insolvent render the stookholder liable to a suit for malicious prosecution, oven if his suit failed, thero having been no arrest of the person or seizure of property.2
			§.~ 046, 047. 2The facts ald conditions which allow (and ststain a stockholder&#x0027;s suit hecrein.- Before a stockholder can sustain a suit to remedy the frauds, ultra vir&#x0027;es acts, or negligence of directors, he should be certain that three distincts facts or conditions exist in his favor. These are: first, that the acts complained of are such as amount to a breach of trust, and such as neither a majority of the directors nor of the stockholders can ratify or condone;&#x0027; sec- ond, that the complaining stockholder himself is free from laches, acquiescence, or ratification of the acts to remedy which the suit is brought;&#x0027; third, that the corporation has been requested and has neglected or refused to institute the suit; that the suit is instituted by bonafido stockholders as complainants, and that the corporation and the guilty parties and other proper parties have been made defendants.5 Bi.

The corporation, how- ever, stands in no fiduciary relation towards its stockholders. Karnes t,. Rochester, etc. R. R., 4 Abb. Pr. (N. 8.) 107 (1867). As stated in Hoyle v. Platts. burgh, etc. R.

			recently said that directors are trustees in their relations towards the corporation, but not in their relations towards the stock. holders.&#x0027; And again, that " while courts of law generally treat the directors as agents, courts of equity treat them as trustees and hold them to a strict account for any breach of the trust relation. For all practical purposes they are trustees when called upon in equity to account for their official conduct." 2 The obligation of this trus- teeship, whether to the corporation or to the stockholders, has been the basis of ascertaining what acts of directors constitute a fraud, and what remedies may be applied. A corporation may file a bill to compel its secretary and treasurer to account for funds coming into his hands, and need not resort to a suit at law. Such a suit is practically one to compel a trustee to account.&#x0027;
			§ 649. Director or other corporate officer interested in construc- tion colapanytw.- It has been held that a director cannot, as against the dissent of a single stockholder, become a contractor with the corporation, nor can he have any personal and pecuniary interest in a contract be- tween a third person and the company of which he is a director.4 I Bloom v.

			" Constituted as humanity is, in the majority of cases duty would be overborne in the struggle." Whore a construction company con- tracts with a corporation, the director cannot be interested in the construction company at the time the contract is made, nor sub- sequently; and it is immaterial that the contract was fair, or even to the advantage of the corporation. The corporation, upon dis- covering the fact that the director is interested in the construction company, may compel him to pay over to the corporation all profits that ho has derived from the construction contract.&#x0027; Again, if a S. 21 (1800). Whero a corporation gives a building contract to one of its di- rectors on his representation that the price is the actual cost of the work, when in fact he had already arranged to subcontract it at a less figure, it is a question for the jury as to whether fraud was involved.

Where one of the common council and of the committee granting a street-railway franchise to individuals who convey the same to a corporation becomes a stockholder in that corporation as soon as it is formed, the franchise is void as having been fraudulently obtained.

In this country it very generally has boon (leemed impracticable to adopt a rule which alisoluloly prollibits such contracts."
			In New Jorsoy tle highest court has just decided that a director may contract with the corporation, if tAl contract s a fair one, ani if it is made without concealment, and if it is approved by a ma- jority of the stockholders in meeting assembled.2 Such also seems to be the rule in Now York.&#x0027; On the other hand it has very prop- &#x0027; The court hohl that a director may be employed by a corporation to settle claims against it, hie to receive five per cent. of the face value of the company&#x0027;s bonds used in settlement, and also to receive whatever discount he could get froml the claims, where lie did not vote on the question of his employment, and a jury has found that the contract was made in good faith and was not im. provident, it being shown that the com- pany was pressed and had no other way of raising money, and that the di- rector advanced his own money. A re- ceiver cannot recover back the amount so paid the director. Ft. Payne, etc. Mill v. Hill, 174 Mass. 224 (18099). Not- withstanding a resolution for the issue of stock in payment for a patent does not recite that the patentee is to have a salary, yet that fact may be shown by parol evidence, and the fact that the corporation re-assigned the patent as security for such salary is not neces- sarily proof of fraud, even though the&#x0027; patentee is president of the corpora- tion. Gay v. Fair, 175 lass. 521 (1900). 2Even though the directors are to receive a commission on bonds which they sell for the corporation, yet if the stockholders are notified of the same and ratify the transaction in meeting assembled, the minority stockholders cannot complain, the transaction itself being a fair one. The directors may vote their own stock at such meeting and the ratification is legal, even though

			their stocl was necessary in order to carry the resolutions The court said: &#x0027; Like other stockhlolders, they had a right to be influenced by whait they conceived to be for their own interest, and they cannot lawfully be denied the right, nor can it be limited or circum- scribed by the fact that they occupied the position of directors in the com- pany." The court further said: "In Leavenworth v. Chicago Railway Co., 131 U. S. (88, it wits held that the ac- tion of the stocl holders validated the contract where nine out of thirteen directors were personally interested. In the case of Nye n Storer, 108 Mass. 53, and Bjorngaard v. Goodhue County Bank. 49 Minn. 488, a like infirmity in contracts was held to be eliminated by the vote of a majority of stockholders." Hedge v. United States Steel Corp., 54 Atl. Rep. 1 (N. J. 1903). 3 Inasmuch as in New York an agree- mentofa contractor to divide with the officers of the company profits made in the construction of the railroad is legal, unless avoided by the corporation, and is not subject to collateral attack, such a contract will be sustained in Penn- sylvania if the contract was made in New York and pertained to a New York corporation, even though such corpora- tion was thereafter consolidated with a Pennsylvania corporation.

Thus, where the director was a surety for tile contractor, and the latter failed, the former, who Iinished the construction work under compulsion by the company, may set up its acquies- cence as a bar to its suit to recover from him the profits of the transaction.4 Again, where a director purchased an interest in the construction contract after it had been entered into, but sold that interest before any work was done thereunder, the illegality of his connection with the construction company cannot affect the legality of his sale of that interest.&#x0027; Even though a director pre- vents a removal of the company&#x0027;s business to another location on advantageous terms, his reason being that he did not get a secret bonus, yet he is not personally liable for damages for so doing, it appearing that the information which he gave to the parties who were about to deal with the corporation was correct.6 Where the business of a lumber railroad has been exhausted, it is legal for the majority of the directors to vote to extend the road, even thoulgh the extension is to enable them to market their own timber.&#x0027; Upon the consolidation of two companies, it is legal for one of the com- panies to pay the president and vice-president of the other company a sum of money in consideration of their agreeing not to engage individually in the same business during the period of ten years within a defined territory.

We do not wish to be understood as saying that the transaction in question necessarily involved actual fraud on the part of those participating in it." A contract between the president and a third party from whom the company buys lumber, that such third party shall pay him a commiesion, is not illegal perse. The president may collect such com- missions unless it is shown that the agreement was concealed from the cor-

			§ 050. Secretgifts to directorsfroml personls contracting lith tho cor- lioriation.-It is a well-established principle of law that a director commits a breach of trust in accepting a secret gift or secret pay from a person who is contracting or has contracted with the corpo. ration, and that the corporation may compel the director to turn over to it all the money or property so received by him.&#x0027; Thus, an agreement of a third person to pay a certain sum to a director if at certain location of a railroad is adopted, or an agreement to allow him to participate in the profits derived from such location, is not an enforceable contract.2 So also whore a director receives a con- mission from one who obtains a loan from the corporation through the director&#x0027;s influence, the latter may be compelled to pay over the commission to the corporation.&#x0027; A treasurer who receives a secret commission from a party selling to a corporation must turn the same over to the corporation.4
			A similar rule was applied where a director of an insolvent in- surance company accepted a secret gift for re-insuring the com- pany&#x0027;s risks in another insurance company.8 And, in general, whenever an officer or agent of the corporation accepts a secret 1 Quoted and approved in McCluro v.

Patterson, 5 Oreg. 177 (1874), where the agreement to pay money to a di- rector and president of a railway if a depot was located in a certain place was held unenforceable. A subscrip- tion, however, conditioned upon the location of a depot is valid. See § 83, supra. Cf. g 681, infra. In Cook v. Shermnan, 20 Fed.

			Thlero is another largo class of cases, particularly in England, wherein persons who lesiro to form a company for the lpurposo of purchasing and working certain property, such as patents and mines, cause their friends to accept the position of directors or agents, and then give them money or stoole in compensation there- for. T&#x0027;lis is still a common practice in business, but the courts have uniformly held that a stockholder or the corporation or a re- ceiver on the winding up may compel such directors or agents to pay over to the corporation the money roociv(ed, or, if stock was received, then to pay to it the value of such stook.3 renders Irls corporation liable for a bonus of stook in another corporation which lie gives secretly and corruptly tu tih agent of the latter corporation in order to get a contract for the former corporation.

Smith v. Smit, etc. Co., 125 Michl. 234 (1000). Even though a director prevents a removal of the conm- pany&#x0027;s business to another location on advantageous terms, his reason being that he did not get a secret bonus, yet no is not personally liable for damages for so doing, it appearing that the in- formation which lie gave to the par- ties who were about to deal with the corporat ion was correct.

Further, it was, above all, the duty of Dr. Sloan, as a vendor sell- ing property to a company towards which he stood in a fiduciary relation, to see t.hat the executive management of the company was in the hands of a thoroughly independent board of di- rectors, a board over which he could exercise no influence, and which would, as the expression is, keep him at &#x0027;arms&#x0027; length&#x0027; in making the bargain." But the court held that the promoter is not liable unless the company rescinds and restores whatever it has received. In this case the court stated that although the promoter stands In a fiduciary re- lation to the company, yet that lie is not necessarily a trustee of property whicl lie acquires to sell to the com- pany; and that even if ie were, the remedy is resolssion and the turning back of the property to lilIm.

Tile fraud Is not an actualone if the director sold at a fair pIrico and did not ilse his position to induce tile corpo ration to purchase. Such a sale, however, is always a oonstructive fraud, and unless legally ratified is voidable at the option of any director or stockholder.&#x0027;
			There is sonie difficulty In determining what will constitute a confirmation of such a transaction. If a majority of the directors and of tile stockhollors, without counting the votes controlled by the director who is interested, favor a confirmation of the trans. action, a dissenting stockholder cannot bring suit to set it aside unless lie can show the existence of solhe fraud other than the mere fact that the vendor was a director when he made the sale. If, however, a majority of the stockholders, excluding the votes owned directly or indirectly by the guilty parthes, are in favor of bringing the directors to an accounting, greater difficulty arises. The weight of authority holds tlirt the votes o. the director as a stock- holder are to be counted. If, however, actual fraud is involved, tils question is immaterial, since no majority, however large, can ratify actual fraud.2
			§ (653. Sales ot&#x0027;lrol)erty by tthe corporation to corporate officers, and purc&#x0027;h7ascs by corporate qoicer&#x0027;s at fo,&#x0027;rcr&#x0027;osuro and exclution salt&#x0027;s.- One of the most frequent frauds perpetrated upon a corpo- ration and its stockholders is where one or more of the directors purchase property from the corporation directly or indirectly, or participate in the profits of such a purchase. The law is well set- tled that a director&#x0027;s purchase of property from the corporation is voidable at the option of the corporation, even though the direct- ors paid fully as much as the property is worth.s This principle of law was fully established by the cases of Cumberland Coal Com- pany against Sherman &#x0027; and lHoffman Steam Coal Company against Cumberland Coal and Iron Company.5 There are exceptions, how- voted for such purchase. Porter v. Las- sen County, etc. Co., 127 Cal. 201 (1809). Cf. s§ 649, 006, and ch. XLIV. 1 Quoted and approved in Stanley v.

The court also held that the purchase by the directors could be ratified only by the unani- mous vote of all the stockholders, and that a ratification by proxy would not bind the stockholder himself. See also
			Cumberland Coal Co. v. Sherman, 20 Md. 117 (1803). 6 10 Md. 450 (1860), where a minority of the directors purchased part of the corporate property at an undervalua- ..ion and then sold it to the Hoffman Company, in which they were large stockholders. The court held that the latter was chargeable with notice of the voidable act. This case and the preceding one grew out of the same transaction. See also Buell v. Bucking- ham, 10 Iowa, 284 (1804), holding that the purchase is voidable, but not void. 1480

Where a director has been director for three years and then resigns and pur- chases property from the corporation and then is re-elected, the purchase is the same as though he had been director during the whole period, and lie may be held liable for the difference be- tween the price paid by him and the actual value of the property.

			iporato property at foreclosure salo thereof. Tho old rule was that lio could not bo a purchaser, either directly or indirectly, at thl foreclosure sale. This was the rule whether the foreclosure was instituted by those interested in tle corporation or by third par- ties. If the director purollased at such a foreclosure salee h held the property as trustee for tleo benefit of the corporation and the stockholders. Upon being repaid the price he gave therefor, he was bound to make over the property to the corporation.&#x0027; The supreme court of the United States, however, has hold in regard to the president that if the foreclosure is not brought about by the president "in violation of his duties as an officer of the company, his official relations to the ompany prior to the foreolosure&#x0027;did not prevent him from bidding for the property or from being inter- ested in its purchase " by another.2 1 Harts v.

			Where a director purchases property from an insolvent corporation, "it de- volves on the directors to show thlnt the transaction was made in good faith, and that the sale produced the full value of the property.

Hayden v. Official, etc. Co., 42 Fed. Rep. 875 (1800). A director&#x0027;s purchase for the creditors and certain mortgage bondholders of the mortgaged property at a foreclos- ure sale cannot be set aside by a stock- holder five years after the sale, where the road was sold for all it was worth, and was badly in debt, and required large expenditures, and there vas no possible means of raising more money, and the stockholders knew of the con- dition of things, but made no effort to prevent a sale, and the director offered to allow the stockholders to come into a reorganization, and offered to resell the property for less than what he paid for it. This is the rule even though the property subsequently becomes very valuable. Osborne v. lonks, 21 S. W. Rep. 101 (Ky. 1898). An insurance com- pany cannot refuse payment of a loss on the ground that the insurer was a director and had bought the corporate property at a foreclosure sale. Caraher v. Royal Ins. Co., 03 Hun, 82 (1892); asf&#x0027;d, 130 N. Y. 45. As to the purchase of the property by the president and others on a foreclosure, with a view to reorganization, see also cl. LII, infra.

			action.&#x0027; In Miohigan it is hold that as against a stockholder a di- rector may purclltso the property at foreclosure sale.2 Judgment creditors cannot complain whore, upon the foreclosure sale of the corporate property, the president purchases the property at its full valueo. Whero the directors are sureties on corporate notes so- cured by mortgage they may buy in the property at the fore- closure sale for their own protection.&#x0027; Thoro is a limit, however. Thus, where a director who practically controlled the board of direct- ors caused all the earnings of the railroad to be used in improving the property, thereby preventing a payment of interest on the corpo- rate indebtedness and bringing about a foreclosure of the mortgage, the director himself having purchased the bonds secured by tlh mortgage and having purchased tho railroad at the foreclosure sale, the court hold that the purchase at the foreclosure sale by the di- rector was voidable. Upon repayment to him of the purchase price lie was compelled to retransfer the property to the corporation, even though another foreclosure would be the result. Third per- sons who had purchased the road from him with notice stood in no other position than the director himself.&#x0027;
			The same general rules apply to execution sales. A director is 1 Foster v, Belcher&#x0027;s, etc. Co., 118 Mo, 238 (1893). 2 Lucas v. Friant, 111 Mich. 420 (1897). h Inglebhrt v. Thousand Island Hotel Co., 109 N. Y. 454 (1888). A corporate creditor cannot hold a director liable for a profit which he has made in purchas. ing a property at a foreclosure sale even though the corporation was the equi- table mortgagor of such property. Ready v. Smith, 70 S. W. Rep. 484 (Mo. 1902). A sale of property by an insolv- ent corporation to one of its directors is valid as against its creditors where a full consideration was paid therefor. Webb t: Rockefeller, 71 Pac. Rep. 283 (Kan. 1003). A creditor of an insolvent corporation who causes its property to be sold under execution cannot com- plain that a director purchased at the sale at a low price. Potvin t. Denney Hotel Co., 20 Wash. 309 (1901). Where a director purchases the corporate as- sets at a mortgage sale for much less than their value, a creditor of the cor- poration may hold him liable for profits made by him. Fishel t. Goddard, 69 Pac. Rep. 007 (Colo. 1902). A creditor
			cannot complain that the corporation sold some of its property to two direct- ors in consideration of their paying cer- tain of the debts; neither can he claim that the transaction was not duly au- thorized by the board of directors or signed by the proper officers, where he has participated in the results of their action.

So also where a director agrees to redeem from an ex- ecution sale certain corporate property, on an understanding that he does it for the corporation, and his payment is to be a preferred corporate debt, the corporation may redeem long subse- quently, even though the director had, after a time, treated the property us t92 § 053.]

The court said: "The share- holders, at a meeting duly convened for the purpose, can, if they think proper, remunerate directors for their trouble or make presents to thetm for their services out of assets properly di- visible amongst the shareholders them- selves Further, if the company is a going concern, the majority can bind the minority in such a matter as this. But to make presents out of profits is one thing, and to make them out of capital or out of money borrowed by the company is a very different matter." The court held that even the fact that all the stockholders knew of the transaction and acquiesced therein was not sufficient. Cf. Re Woods, etc. Co., 02 L. T. Rep. 760 (1890).

As a rule, even though the boards of directors of two corporations are the same, and one buys out tho property of the other, yet the transaction is not void, and will not be set aside at the instance of a stockholder unless ho shows damage.2 A contract be- tween two corporations will not bo declared invalid because the corporations have common directors, whore its fairness is manifest."

Where a rolling-stock company by its board of five directors makes acon- tract with a railroad company having thirteen directors, five of whom are the same as the directors of the rolling- stock company. and the railroad com- pany makes the contract at a meeting of eight directors, two of whom are of the five, and for two years the railroad company lives up to the contract, it cannot then repudiate.

Where a director is one of t com- mitteoo appointed by the board of direct- ors to settle claims against the corpo- ration, and he buys some of tho claims, lie must turn themn in at the price ho paid, and even though the stockholders and directors intended to allow him tho profit, yet this does not estop the corpo. ration from objecting.

Lansinlg, 151 Ill. 301 (1893), the court said that if a director acts fiirly and for the interest of the corpo. ration, he may buy up at a discount a debt of the corporation and enforce such debt at its full face value, provided the corporation was given an opportu- nity itself to become the purchaser and could not or would not purchase. The court held, however, in the case before It that the purchase on the part of the director was fraudulent, and that the director could collect only the amount he paid. The fact that a director buys up the securities of an insolvent corpo- ration for the purpose of using them in reorganization is not fraudulent or a breach of his duty, he having paid all that the securities were worth. Powell v. Willamette Valley R. R., 15 Oreg. 393 (1887). In Inglehart v. Thousand Island Hotel Co., 109 N. Y. 454 (1888), 32 Hun, 377, the assignee of a judgment

Hitchcock t&#x0027;. Barrett, 50 Fed. Rep. 653 (1802). Although a lessee railroad company has directors, a minority of whom are largely interested in the stock and bonds of the lessor railroad. and such bonds and stock are largely " water," yet this does not necessarily vitiate the lease. The court will not set the lease aside if no undue advantage was taken and no actual fraud involved. Jesup v. Illinois Cent. .I R., 43 Fed. Rep. 483 (1890).

An agree- mnoit of persons holding a majority of the stook, thoy being directors also, that a person purchasing stock from thelm shall be general manager, and nimly at the end of two years sell the stock bnok to them at a stated price, is contrary to publilo policy and void. The vendors need not repurchaso. The arrangement is unfair to the corpora- tion. Wilbur t. Stoopol, 82 Mich. 8.14 (1U90). It is illegal for directors to be stockholders in a construction company to which a construction contract is let. Oillman, etc. R. R. v. Kelly, 77 111. 426 (187o). In England it seems that under the statutory power of one company to sell out to another, the sale may be for cash, nnd the minority are bound, even though the majority own the purchas- ing company. But all the cash must be paid, and not merely the part thatgoes to the minority. Hoist v. Sydney, etc. Ry., 00 L T. Rep. 132 (1803).

			or ditra vi&#x0027;es one. Again, whore one corporation buys out nnother, a ntockholdel r of the former cannot complain, even though a large amount of watered stock was issued in payment, and oven though the directors of tile purchasing company were personally interested in tile soiling company and had made large profits in tile construc- tion of the work, it appearing that tile purochasing company had no property at all at tile tiim of teo purchaseo. In such a case no dam- ago is (lone to tile stockholder, andt honco suit by him does not lie. lBut whero a lease is made, antd the directors of tho lessee railroad company are also directors of the lessor company, and own a ma- jority of tile stock of both companies, a stockholder of the lessee company alleging that the lease is at an exorbitant rent and unlaw- fully depletes the funds and earnings of tile lessee company, and in- jures him as a stockholder, and alleging also that the directors have unlawfully paid large sums to themselves on account of alleged loans, may by a bill in equity compel them to account.3
			Where the officors of a lessee corporation, which has leased tho property of tile lessor corporation, control a majority of the stock of the latter, and conspire to compel the minority to sell their stock by refusing to pay the rent due on the lease, a court of equity, on the application of the minority, will compel a payment of the rent.&#x0027; The question as to the liability of a director who is interested as a stockholder in a contracting construction company is considered elsewhere.&#x0027;
			A lease to a director is not necessarily illegal, even though a stockholder objects thereto, where a majority of the stockholders have ratified the lease."
			Where a director has sold his property to thecorporation, or has committed some other act which is voidable and not void, and writers at the same price in considera- tion of the underwriters agreeing to take such of the stock as is offered to the stockholders and is not taken by the latter, a minority stockholder may enjoin the carrying out of such option to the underwriters, it being in viola- tion of the English statute prohibiting the payment of a commission for under- writing subscriptions. Burrows v. Mat- abele, etc. Co., [1901] 2 Ch. 23.

			whoro a majority of tle stock can ratify and validate that act, it being not actually fraudulent, but merely voidable at the option of tlhe stockholders, the important question arises whether, in taking the vote of tilo stockholders on such a question, tile stock held by the director himself is to be counted. The well-settled rule is that his stock is to be counted, even though tile vote would have failed if his stock had not been voted.&#x0027;
			I A director may sell property to tlh corporatlon where the purlchas is adopted at a meeting of the stockhold- ers. Such director may vote il favor of such purchase all the stock that he owns; but if the result is "so detri- mental to the interests of the corpora- tion itself as to lend to the necessary inference that the intorests of the man jority of the shareholders lie wholly outside of and in opposition to the in- terests of the corporation and of the n.i- nority of the sharelolders, and that their action is a wanton or fraudulent destruction of the rights of such mi- nority," then a court of equity will set the act aside. Gamble r. Queen&#x0027;s, etc. Co., 123 N. Y. 91 (1800). The court said: "In such cases it may be stated that the action of the majority of the share. holders may be subjected to the scru- tiny of a court of equity at the suit of the minority shareholders." Even though the directors are to receive a commission on bonds which they sell for the corporation, yet if the stock- holders are notified of the same and ratify the transaction in meeting as- sembled, the minority stockholders can- not complain, the transaction itself being a fair one. The directors may vote their own stock at such meeting. and the ratification is legal, even though their stock was necessary in order to carry the resolutions. Hedge r. United States Steel Corp., 54 Atl. Rep. 1 (N. J. 1903). The court said: &#x0027;Like other stockholders, they had a right to be influenced by what they conceived to be for their own interest, anld they cannot lawfully be denied the right, nor can it be limited or circumscribed
			by the fact that they occupied the posi- tion of directors in the company." The court further said: "In Leavenwortl v. Chicago Railway Co., 184 U. S. 688, it was held that the action of the stockholders validated the contract whero nine out of thirteen directors were personally interested. In the case of Nye v. Storer, 108 Mass. 53, and Bjorngaard v. Goodhue County Bank, 40 Minn. 483, a like infirmity in con- tracts was hleld to be eliminated by the vote of a majority of stockholders." A purchase of a steamboat from one who is a director and owns a majority of the stock is valid where ratified hy n majority vote at a stockholders&#x0027; meet- ing. The director may vote his stock. Northwest Transp. Co. v. Beatty, L. R. 12 App. Cas. 589 (1887). It was said, in effect, that in such case the ratification must not be brought about by unfair or improper means, nor beillegal or fraud- lent or oppressive toward those share- holders who oppose it. A rule exclud- ing stockholders from the right to vote, merely because they might be person- ally interested to vote in a particular way, contrary to the interests of the other stockholders, would be likely to lead to great confusion. Beatty v. Northwest Transp. Ce, 5 Can. L T. 277 (1885) (rev&#x0027;g s. C, 4 Can. L T. 85), hold- ing that a purchase by the directors of a vessel from one of the directors could not be set aside by a dissenting stock- holder where a majority of the stock had ratified the purchase, even though the director himself held and voted that majority. A stockholder may vote to ratify a purchase of property from a corpora- l-25

			Second, a similar situation arises where one corporation owns a majority of the stock of another, ant hence controls it, and brings about a lense, consolidation, sale, or contract between the two.t This is very much the sanme as where a corporation sells property to one of its directors,2 or buys property from himn.&#x0027; The courts tion by the diroctors, although such stockholder Is a director hiilself. The court said: "The fact that lio may have a plersonal intorest separate from the otheors or from that of the corpora. tion in tle matter to bo voted upon does not nfTect his right to vote, It is not to be understood that the majority stoklholhlers nmay uso their power of voting for the purpose of defrauding the minority." Bjorngaard v. Goodhue County 1ank, 40 Miin. 483 (1802); Soss v. IaIrbottle, 2 Iare, .101 (18.13), where the directors sold their property to the corporation. Inasmuch as the major- ity of stockholders could ratify the pur- chase, the court refused to entertain a stockholders&#x0027; suit until they had voted. Whereo person fraudulently miisrepre- sented a mine in its sale to the com- pany for shares of stock, a suit by the company against liin does not lie where a majority of the stock votes against the suit, although the shares obtained by the vendee were voted by him and were necessary to make the majority, and although he was a director of the company at the time. East, etc. Co. v. Merryweather, 2 Hem. &#x0026; .L 254 (1854). This case goes much farther than the modern rule would uphold. See Mason v. Harris, L R. 11 Ch. D. 97 (1879), hold. ing explicitly that where a director is guilty of fraud as a promoter, a dissent- ing stockholder may bring him to an accounting, although the director con. trols the directorate and a majority of the shares of stock. Also Atwool v. Merryweather, L It. 5 Eq. 401, note (1867), where a dissenting stockholder sued to set aside a sale of property to the company by the defendant, who di. vided the profits with one of the direct- ors. Although a majority of the stock. holders had voted not to bring the
			action, yet this majority was madlo up by counting the stock of the guilty parties, andl hloneo was not binding. In a stockholders&#x0027; vote ratifying the acts of directors, a stockholder lhas no right to vote stock whichi he has transferred to others, even though it still stands il his iiime on the boolks. Graves v. Iono Lake, etc. Co., 81 Cal. 303 (1889). A oreditor who is also a stockholder may vote h1i stock in favor of a mortgage to himiself. Iittenliouse v. Winch, 11 N. Y. Supp. 122 (1800). Works built by a director in opposition to the corpora. tion may be purchased by the lhtter and new stock issued thereor. Such a transaction is certainly legal where a majority of the minority stockholders, not including the parties interested, vote in favor of it. Barr v. Pittsburgh, etc. Co., 01 Fed. Rep. 33 (1892). In Cun- berland Coal Co. v. Sherman, 80 Barb. 553 (1859), the court held that a unani- mous vote of the stockholders was necessary to confirmn. A ratification by the stockholders of directors&#x0027; acts cannot be made by a general resolution ratifying " all of the acts of the officers." Farmers&#x0027; L. &#x0026; T. Co. v. San Diego, etc. Co., 45 Fed. Rep. 518 (1801), holding also that the directors holding a majority of the stock cannot by its vote ratify a. preference to them by the corporation, which isinsolvent. A stockholder may vote on the propriety of a sale to the corporation in which he is interested as vendor. Worth, etc. Co. v. Bingham, 116 Fed. Rep. 785 (1002). T This is practically a private sale of the corporate property to one of the stockholders and may be objected to. See BMason v. Pewabib Min. Co., 133 U. S. 50 (1890).

			will scrutinizo tlh transaction very closely and will set it aside, at the instance of a stockholder, i&#x0027; it is unreasonable, unfair, and prac- tically fraudulent.&#x0027; Tile Now York court of appeals has well said I Wllere ono railroad owns a majority of tho stock and controls tle board of directors of another railroad, and causes the latter to lease its road to the former, a stoclkholder of the former may file a bill in equity to sot aside such lease on tbo ground that its terms were so in. equitable as to constitute fraud. In suchl case no doenand need bo made to the board of directors to bring tile suit, if the facts alleged In the bill show that tile board of directors in controlled by the guilty party. Rogers r. Nashville, etc. Ry., 91 Fed. Rep. 320 (1808). Where one mining company owns the majority of the stock of another miling company and elects the directors of the latter, and causes its property to be sold out to tile former on its own terms, the minority stockholders of the latter may cause the sale to be set aside, even though no actual fraud is shown. Glengary, etc. Co. v. Boehller, 02 Pac. Repl. 839 (Col. 1000). This would seem to be the logical rule under the decision of the supreme court of the United States in Mason v. Pewabic Min. Co., 133 U. S. 50 (1880), which held that a majority of the stockholders could not sell out all the property of the company to themselves at a fixed price at a private sale, even though the minority stockholders were given an opportunity to participate in such sale the same as the majority stockholders. See on this subject g 071, infra. Where one corporation has taken a lease of the property of another and guarantees dividends on the stock of the latter, and then acquires a majority of the stock of the latter and proposes to rescind such an agreement. a minor- ity stockholder may enjoin such action. McLeary v. Erie, etc. Co., 38 N. Y. Misc. Ilep. 3 (1003). Even though one rail- road company owns the majority of the stock of another railroad company and

Rothllllld v. Memphis, etc. II R., 113 Fed. Rep. 470 (1002), Wlhere an Insolvent savings bank is really controlled by a national bank, although they have not the same direct- ors, yet the former cannot prefer the latter. It is an illegal preference in behalf of the directors. Slack v.

Stevens v. Missouri, etc. Ry., 100 Fed. Rep. 771 (1001). As to one corporation voting stock in another corporation, see § 015, sutpra. Where one street railway owns all the stock of another street railway (ex- cepting five shares, the owner of which does not object), and the former makes a contract authorizing a third street railway to run its cars over the tracks of the company whose stock is so owned, such contract is legal and will be en- forced.

The pro- vision in a lease that any differences arising shall be decided by arbitration cannot be avoided by a minority stock- holder, even though the lessee owns a majority of the stock of the lessor and controls its board.

			that whoro "a majority of the stock is owned by a corporation or a combination of individuals, and it assumes tile control of another .company&#x0027;s business and affairs through its control of the olllers and directors of tile corporation, it would soom tlat for all prac- tical purposes it becomes tlh corporation of which it holds a ma- jority of stock, and assumes the same trust relation towards the minority stockholders that a corporation itself usually bears to its stockhollers."&#x0027;
			Third, the same principles of law apply, whore an individual or several individuals, instead of a corporation, own tleo majority of the stock of another corporation and bring about a sale, lease, con- solidation, contract, or foreclosure, to their own personal gain, at the expense of minority stockholders. The law requires of the majority of the stockholders the utmost good faith in their control and management of the corporation as regards the minority, and in this respect the majority stand in much the same attitude to- wards the minority that the directors sustain towards all the stock- holders. Icnce, where the majority are interested in another cor- poration, and the two corporations have contracts between them, it is fraudulent for that majority to manage the affairs of the first corporation for the benefit of tlhe second. A court of equity will intervene and protect the minority upon an application by the latter.2 The principle of law has been laid down that " when a of the former company fraudulently, a minority stockholder may bring the latter company to account therefor.

This decision wa;s fol- lowed in a stockholders&#x0027; suit in the fed- eral court to remedy the same wrong lu De Neufville v. New York, etc. Ry., 81 Fed. Rep. 10 (1897). A stockholder in one railroad corporation cannot maintain a suit at law against another railroad corporation for damages to his shares of stock on accoynt of the latter railroad corporation owning a majority of the stock of the former, and so man-

			lThere aro many other instances in which the corporato existence will not sullice to ovade liabilities, disabilities, and frauds. An in- dividual or partnership cannot transfer all of his or its property to a corporation for shares of stock and thereby defraud the creditors of the partnership.&#x0027; The ollicers and agents of a corporation who cause tile corporation to defraud its creditors or subscribers to its stock by means of fraudulent misrepresentations are liable to tile persons so defrauded.&#x0027; The stockholders and ollceers of a corpora-. tion which was not properly organized may be liable as partners for all of its debts,&#x0027; but this liability is not based on fraud.
			A few cases hold that a corporation incorporated in one state for the purpose of ldoin all its business in another state is a fraud on tile law, and is only a partnership; but the weight of authority holds otherwise." If the promoters or ollicers or a majority of stockholders defraud the corporation itself or the minority stock- holders, a court of equity will give full and ready relief.&#x0027; Where persons in control of a corporation use that control to defraud per- sons with whom they have contracted in refereice to stock, a court of equity will aid the persons so (lefraud(ed.. Tho stockholders of a corporation are (listinet from the corporation itself,9 and may of course transact business irrespective of its contracts or obligations; then sells the patent to the corpora- tion on terms entirely beyond his authority, his principal may repudiate the sale, and the company is not a bona fide purchaser. inabmuch as its pro- jector and organizer was the attorney. Another company to which the princi- pal again assigns his patent may sue the former company for infringement. Young, etc. Co. r. Young, etc. Co., 72 Fed.

			Where a corporation secures a rebate from a railroad company, not only on shipments mado by the forimer, but on shipients made by other parties, the active agents of sulch corporations receiving such moneys imay be hold personally liable for them. The court said that inasmluchl s the company " was organized by the plro- ilioters, tlh defendants, simply for tile purpose of consulmmating the illegal agreeiment and slielling themnselves from the conse- (uences of receiving the illegal exactions male under it, the act of incorporating can be of no avail to thenm as a defense."
			Tlhe subject of the personal liability of ollcers and directors of corporations is moro fully considered elsewhere.&#x0027;
			Tlhe New York court of appeals lias laid down a general rule as follows: "In no legal sense can the business of n corporation be said to be that of its individual stockholders. It is true that they have an interest in the business carried on, and an influence in controlling its conduct; but they have created a legal entity to prosecute such business, mnke its contracts, and be responsible for its obligations, and that entity is alone responsible to persons dealing with it for the conduct of such business."4 This rule is ISee King t. Barnes, 118 N. Y. 476 (1880). An injunction against certain directors of the corporation from using patented articles is violated by their forming a new corporation to do the samne acts, they being directors also of the latter.

The fact that the stockholders in two corporations are the same, or that one corporation exer- cises a control over the other through ownership of its stock or through the identity of the stockholders, such cor- porations being separately organized under distinct charters, does not make either the agent of the other, nor merge them into one so as to make a contract of one corporation binding upon the other.

The court de- clined, however, to hold that it would ignore the existence of the American corporation, "because experience has certainly satisfied me that if you give a decision embodying large principles and large considerations without hav- ing felt exactly where the shoe pinches, it is very likely that the next case that may turn up will show that some con- sideration has been omitted which might have been very vital, or might have affected one&#x0027;s judgment."

Much that one man cannot do alone two can do together, and once we ad- mit the fact that co-operation, or, what is the same thing, combination, is necessary on a small scale, the limit depends solely upon the necessities of business. Two persons in partnership may be a sufficiently large combination for a small business, but if the business
			1540
			grows or can be made to grow, moro persons and moro capital must be taken in. The business may grow so large tlnt a partnership ceases to be a proper instrumentality for its purposes, and then a corporation becomes a necessity. In most countries, as in England, this form of industrial combination is sull. cient for a business co-extensive with tile parent country, but it is not so in this country. Our federal form of government, making every corporation created by a state foreign to every other state, renders it necessary for persons doing business through cor- porate agency to organize corporations in some or many of the different states in wliich their business is located. In- stead of doing business through the agency of one corporation, they must do business through the agencies of several corporations."

			corporation sells all its property to an Illinois railroad corporation in exchange for stock of the latter, which is issued to the stock- holders of thle former, the latter does not thereby become a Ncbraskal corporation, preventing the removal of cases to the fed- eral court.&#x0027; The agreemennt of a telephone company to pay to an- other company twenty per cent. of all rentals or royalties received by the former does not entitle the latter to any interest in stock of subsidiary companies which the telephone company has formed and to wlhich it has given licenses, where the rental above men- .tioned is paid on the teleplones used by such subsidiary companies.2 Soimetimes a "dummy" corporation is used to hold land, the stockholders being aliens or foreign corporations.3
			This general rule, however, like all general rules, has exceptions, and the New York court of appeals stated the exception forcibly as follows: "We have of late refused to be always and utterly tram- meled by the logic derived from corporate existence where it only serves to distort or hide the truth."&#x0027; And again: "The abstrac- tion of the corporate entity should never be allowed to bar out nnd pervert tle real and obvious truth." 5
			Tlle chief application of this statement of law is in cases of fraud," but there is a line of cases which apply this rule where there is no fraud, and where the owner of the stock is held liable merely bc- cause he owns all the stock of the corporation. Thus, it has been held that where a railroad company causes a telegraph company to be incorporate(l, and subscribes to all its stock, and appoints all its ollicers, and holds it out as the future owner of a telegraph system which the railroad owns, and then sells that system to someone else, a person contracting with the telegraph company on the faith of the scheme being carried out may hold the railroad company liable on the contract, on the principle o0 a principal being liable on the contracts of its agent.7 It has also been held that where the cor- poration does business by organizing branch corporations, and the company in the smaller is no reason for Buit v.

And even though the preliminairy contract provided for the acquisition of a certain company, yet if the consolidated company acquires practically all the stock and bonds of that company, the party turning in se- curities cannot withdraw, and espe- cially cannot reclaim the securities as against a transferee in good faith who had no notice of personal representa- tions.

This term hasbeen objected to as having no fixed and clear meaning, and to some extent the objection is reasonable. There is no other term, however, that has acquired the significance, general use, and peculiar meaning that are attached to the words ultra vires; and consequently the term probably has acquired a per- manent place in the vocabulary of corporation law.&#x0027;
			" The contracts of corporations are said tobe ultra vires vwhen they involve some adventure or undertaking not within the scope of their charter, which is their rule of corporate action." Les- lie v. Lorillard, 110N. Y. 519(1888). For various definitions of the words ultra vires, see Pierce, Railroads (3d ed.,

			§ 008. Mel7od of treatmenlct of tl slt1&#x0027;jct.-Tliero has boon ox- tromo dlilllculty and confusion in defining the validity, effect, riglts, and remedies of an ultra vires neat. The attempt to formulate general rules on this subject has only added to the confusion.&#x0027; Ac- cordingly, the plan of oxplanation pursued in this work is to state tlose acts wllicl have boon adjudged ultra vires,&#x0027; alnd also those Jones, 05 N Y. 115 (1884); Greon&#x0027;s Brice, Ultra Viros (2d ed.), 53; Miners&#x0027; Ditch Co. r. Zcllorbach, 87 Cal. 543, 570 (1809); McPhorson t. Foster, 43 Iowa, 48, 01, 05 (1870,; Aslbury, etc. Co . I. Rlce, L. It 7 11. L 053:, 072 (1875); 2 Kent&#x0027;s Corn. *300 (12th ed.), note. Two dilllculties have arisen in agreeing upon defioni- tlon of this term. First, the term ultra vires was often used to designate not only acts beyond the express and inm- plied powers of the corporation, but also acts which are contrary to public policy, and are void whetheor done by corpora- tions or individuals. Such acts when done by corporations are now termed "illegal "acts, and the terni ultra vircs is not used so as to include them.. Sec- ond, the term ultra vires has been ap- plied to acts which are beyond the pow. ers of the directors, but within the pow- ers of the majority of the stockholders. This use of the term, however, is now discarded, and it is used to designate acts which are beyond the powers of a majority of the stockholders as against a minority; or are beyond the powers of the stockholders acting unanimously as against the state. In Taylor v. Chi- chester, etc. Ry., L. . 2 Exch. 350, 878 (1867), Blackburn, J., said: " I think it very unfortunate that the same phrase ultra vires has been used to express both an excess of authority as against the shareholders, and the doing of an act illegal as being malurn prolhibitum; for the two things are substantially different: and I think the use of the same phrase for both has produced con- fusion." Even though a railroad is giv- ing a lower rate to one customer than to another, yet a stockholder cannot maintain a suit of injunction to coln-
			1548
			pel the party to pay what he should have paid. Whil the act is Illegal, it is not ultra vircs, and as to the Illegal act it is for the corporation to decide wilether or not it will su. Anderson t. Mlidland Ry., 85 L T. Rep. 408(1001) 1 For instance, the general rule that "any ambiguity in the terms of the grant must operate against the corpora- tion and in favor of the public, and the corporation can claim nothing that is not clearly given by the law," etc. (Perrino v. Chesapeake, etc. Co., 0 How. 172- 1850), is sound law, and has been laid down in many cases; but as a matter of fact, this principle gives little light or satisfaction to til bench, bar, or layman. Each case turns largely on its own facts. Moreover, the decision turns largely on who sues, who is sued, what relief is sought, and whether the act has been performed by one side or not. General rules cannot clearly make the distinctions. The old ideas have been changed. Indeed it is refreshing to hear from that great judge, Mr. Justice Miller, such sound sense as this: "The truth is, that, with the great increase&#x0027; in corporations in very recent times and in their extension to nearly all the business transactions of life, it has been found necessary to hold them respon- sible for acts not strictly within their corporate powers. but done in their cor- porate name, and by corporation officers who were competent to exercise all the corporate powers." Salt Lake City v. Hollister, 118 U. S. 256 (1880). See also Pennsylvania R. R t. Keokuk, etc. Co., 131 U. S. 371. 384. 389 (1889); Stour- bridge Canal r.

			acts hllicll have been adjudged to be intra vilr&#x0027;.t It must bo borno in mind that nearly every corporate act is ultra virCs or intra vires in ia broad sense. It was from this standpoint that Professor Brico&#x0027;s work on Ultra Vires was written. The plan bs this book, however, has been to divide the subject into other and more practical head- ings, such as " preferred stock" and the various other chapter head- ings heroin contained, rather than to group everything under the heading of ultra vires or intra vires. Most corporate acts, whetheor Ultra vires or intra vires, have been or will be considered in other parts of this book. Hence &#x0027;only such subjects are treated here as are not extensive enough or important enough for separate chap- tors.
			In general, it remains to add that at common law an ultra vires act umay be objected to by the state, a stockholder, the corpora- tion, or the person contracting with the corporation; and since often one of these parties may sustain the objection, where the others are not allowed to (do so, it is necessary to consider always the four questions: Who brings the suit; who is sued; what act is complained of; and what performance has already been had. It rarely happens that the state objects to an ultra vires act. That it has a right to object by quo warranto is undoubted.2 The question of when and whether the stockholder must first apply to the di- rectors or stockholders to remedy the wrong before he brings suit,3 and also the question of when a ratification of the act by the other stockholders is a bar,4 is considered elsewhere.
			The tendency is to limit the application of the doctrine of ultra vires, especially in regard to partially executed contracts. In this respect the New York court of appeals is in conflict with the supreme court of the United States."
			§ 669. A stocklholder may object to an ultra vires act.-That a charter constitutes a contract between the corporation and its stock- holders is a principle of law that has become firmly imbedded in the jurisprudence of modern times." Upon this principle of law rest the stability, permanence, and honesty of management of many cor- porations, particularly those of railroads, and from it arises much of the confidence, safety, and protection of the stockholder himself. It was first promulgated in America, in 1820, in Livingston v. Lynch,7 and was applied to corporations in Hartford &#x0026; New Haven Railroad Company v. Croswell,s and in England, in 1824, in Na- 1 This is the subject of the following 6 Quoted and approved in Harding v. chapter, XLL American, etc. Co, 182 IlL 651 (1899). 2 See § 035, supra.

			tusoh v. Trving.&#x0027; Theso cases have been followed by a long list of supporting decisions. They woro the first to establish clearly tlh doctrine tlat any act or proposed act of the corporation, or of the directors, or of a majority of the stockholders, which is not within the express or implied powers of tile charter of incorporation or of association - in other words, any ultra vires act - is a breach of the con tract between the corporation and each one of its stocklloll- ors, and that consequently any one or more of the stockholders may object thereto and compel the corporation to observe the terms of the contract as set forth in the charter.&#x0027;

American llard Rubber Com- pany&#x0027; tile law hals been clearly established in this country that a dissenting stockholder ny: prevent the sale of all the corporate property by the directors or by a majority of the stockholders, lwhere the corporation is a solvent, going concern.&#x0027; And even 12 Cooper&#x0027;s Ch. 358, by Lord Eldon; also reported in Gow on Partnership, 308. Thus, Lord Chancellor Cainpbell, in Simpson v. Westminster, etc. Co., 8 L L. Cas. 712 (1800), said: "I bow to the authority of Natusch t. Irving.... The funds of a joint-stock company established for one undertaking cannot be applied to another. If an attempt to do so is made, this act is ultra vires; and, although sanctioned by all the di- rectors and by a large majority of the shareholders, any single shareholder has a right to resist it, and a court of equity will interpose on his behalf by injunction." In Pickering v. Stephen- son, L. R 14 Eq. 322 (1872), the court said: " It is difficult to conceive any system of jurisprudence in which Na- tusch v. Irving would have been differ- ently decided." 2 Quoted and approved in Harding v. American, etc. Co., 182 IlL 551 (1899). A stockholder may file a bill to enjoin or set aside an ultra vires act, even though every other stockholder is opposed to him. Hoole v. Great West- ern Ry,, L. . 3 Ch. App. 202 (1807); Beeman v.

Burns, 71 L. T. Rep. 700 (1807), was nffirmod in 77 L. T. Rep. 877, to the of- foot that a person having an option to iprchaso the unissued stock of a coin. panly has a olaihll for damage in case tie companly sells thu business to an. other company without protecting such option. Wllere, by a majority vote of the stockholdors, all the assets of a Maine corporation are transferred to a New Jersey corporation, the latter agreeing to pay all the debts and to issue one share of its stock for every two shares of the stock in the former corporation, and for two years the New Jersey cor- poration fails to pay such debts and the stock of the Maine corporation has not been fully delivered, a dissenting stock- holder in the Maine corporation may enjoin the New Jersey corporation from disposing of such assets.

In a stockholder&#x0027;s suit to set aside an illegal transfer of the assets of his corporation to another corporation and to compel a re-transfer, the persons through whom the prop- erty was transferred i.ed not be made parties if the persons in possession of the assets are made parties. lldred v. American, etc. Co., 99 Fed. Rep. 6IS (1900). But the federal court in New Jer- sey has no jurisdiction of a suit brought by stockholders in a Maine corporation against that corporation and a New Jersey corporation to set aside an ille- gal transfer of property from the Maine corporation to the New Jersey corpora- tion, the property itself not being in New Jersey. Eldred v. American, etc. Co.. 105 Fed. Rep. 455 (1900). Moreover, if the Maine corporation is not served and does not voluntarily appear, final
			relief cannot be granted and a proliml. nary injunction will be dissolved. El- dred v. American, etc. Co., 105 Fed. Rep. 457 (1000). In a stoolcholder&#x0027;H sllit to set asldo a sale by a Maine corpora- tlon of all its assets to a New Jersey corporation, the suit being in New Jer- sey, the Maine corporation is a neces. sary party defendant, and a court ill Maine will not appoint a receiver of the same for the sole purpose of appearing in the suit in New Jersey. Hutchin- son v. American, etc. Co., 10, Fed. Rep. 182 (1000). A New York&#x0027; court will not, at the instance of a New York stockholder i n an Arizona mining com- pany, enjoin the company fromn trans- ferring its property in Arizona, and ap- point a receiver thereof, intismuch as such an injunction will not be effec- tive except with the aid of the Arizona courts, and the question involved is one relating to the internal affairs of the company which should be con- trolled by the statutes and public pol- icy of Arizona. The court, however, in the final decree, may set aside ille- gal sales, even though the property is beyond the jurisdiction. Hallenborg v. Greene, 66 N.Y. App. Div. 590 (1901). Where tie secretary and treasurer has managed the business as though the property was his own, a sale of all the property with the consent of ninety- five per cent. of the stockholders to an innocent purchaser for value is legal, even though no meeting of the direct- ors or stockholders authorized the sale.

Mum ford v. Ecuador, etc. Co., 00 Atl. Rep. ,70 (N. J. 1901?. Where a minority sto-lkholder starts a suit in the fed- eral court to set aside a sale of the property of the company to another corporation, but does not bring in as a party defendant a railway company which is about to issue securities, in accordance with contracts witlh the two collpanies, and afterwards starts a suit in the state court for the same relief, and brings in the railway coin- pany as party defendant, laches in bringing in the railway company is a bar to relief against that company. A protest not followed by prompt appli- cation to a court does not excuse laches. Mumford v. Ecuador, etc. Co., 50 Atl. Rep. 476 (N. J. 1901). In the case of Drake v. New York, etc. Co., 30 N. Y. App. Div. 275 (1899), where the owner of ten out of two thousand shares of stock attacked a foreclosure decree on the ground of fraud, the court refused to grant relief, the purchaser at tlhe foreclosure sale being willing to pay to such stockholder his proportion of the actual value of the property, irrespect- ive of the price realized at the fore- closure sale. The court said that the expense of further litigation would be many times the actual value of the plaintiff&#x0027;s interest, and that, while the plaintiff in a court of law would be en-
			titled to the full measure of llis legal rights, yet in a court of equity a differ ont rule prevails, and lie may be com- pelled to take his actual interest.

In this case a New York subscriber to stock in an English cor. poration was sued by the company for the amount of such subscription, such company having been reorganized under the peculiar English statutes. The court refused to enforce the lia- bility on the ground that the funds were not for the purpose of paying debts of the old corporation, but were partially for the purposes of the new corporation which the New York sub- scriber did not become interested in and had no notice thereof, and on the further ground that the reorganization scheme was practically a sale by the old company to the new company.

This, perhaps, is the first reorganization case that is to be found in the books. The whole business of the corporation cannot be sold out except by unani- mous consent of the stockholders, but a stockholder who acquiesces in it can- not afterwards conplain. Fold r. Ro- anoke Inv.

Where a part of a charter is illegal, and a new corporation is formed to take over the property and debts and issue share for share of stock in the old, a stockholder who assented cannot now refuse to take the new stock. Glymont Imp. etc. Co. v. Toller, 80 Md. 278(1894). Five years after a corporation has sold all its property to another corporation, and received the consideration, it can- not maintain a bill to set aside the sale as ultra rires, the rights of third par- ties having intervened in the mean- time.

The New York courts refused to hold a New York stockholder in an English corpo- ration liable for his unpaid subscrip. tion where under a plan of reorganiza- tion, sanctioned by the English courts, in accordance with English law, tih amount collected is to go to the reor- ganized company, while other stock- holders need not pay their subscrip- tions if they take part in the reorgan- ized company and pay a small sum, especially where if all the stockholders paid in full, the amount would be more than necessary to pay the debts. Bank of China r. Morse, 108 N. Y. 458 (1901). Under an English floating debenture, stockholders have no right to sell out the entire property to another corpora- tion in exchange for stock unless the debenture holders consent, Foster v. Borax Co.. [1899] 2 Ch. 180, or unless money is deposited in court to pay the dissenting debenture holders. Foster v. Borax Co., [1899] 2 Ch. 130, 137. Under a statute authorizing one com- pany to sell out to another for any con- sideration that may be agreed upon between them, it is legal that the con- sideration be a right extended by the new company to the old stockholders to demand partly paid up stock of the new company within a limited time, a dissenting stockholder being given the
			right to have the firness of tile pro. posed sale plassed uponl by the court, It is the duty of the stockholder ll such a case to attend the meeting and vote against it if he objects. It isnoexcuse that he was ill or abroad or negligent in dissenting under the English statute. Burdett-Coutts v. True Blood, etc. Ltd., [1809] 2 Cl. 016. It is not legal for a receiver, even under an order of the court, to sell nearly all the property of the company to another corporation in exchange for stock of the latter to I1&#x0027; given to stockholders of the former, with a provision that dissenting stock- holders should be paid on a certain basis which is different from stock of the former corporation acquired by the latter corporation.

A pledgee of the stock of the old corporation may bring suit for that purpose. Smith v. Smith, etc. Co., 84 N. W. Rep. 144 (Mich. 1000). Taylor t.

Although a cor- poration is authorized by its charter "to take stock " in other corporations, this does not authorize it to sell all its property to another corporation in pay- ment for stock of that corporation to be distributed among the stockholders of the vendor corporation. Elyton Land Co. v. Dowdell, 113 Ala. 177 (1890). Where a corporation sells its business for stock in another company, it may distribute the stock among those of its stockholders who are willing to take it; but any stockholder may demand money instead.

A statute forbidding the ollcers of a mining corporation from selling its property, without such sale being approved by a certain proportion of the stock at a meeting of the stock- holders, does not authorize a sale of all the assets of a prosperous mining cor- poration as against the dissent of mi- nority stockholders, where such sale is not for cash but for the capital stock of a foreign corporation, even though such latter company offers to pay a fixed price in cash to stockholders who do not care to take new &#x0027;tock in ex- change for the old. A minority stock- holder may enjoin the sale even though the selling corporation offers to give to such minority stockholder a bond that the dissenting stockholders should re- ceive the value of their stock. A court has no power to compel dissenting stockholders toso dispose of their shares iin vito. Forrester v. Boston, etc. Co., 21 Mont. 544, 505 (188). A by-law, even though passed upon tie organization of the company, cannot legally provide that upon a sale of the company&#x0027;s prop- erty for stock iu another company, the stock going to dissenting stockholders might be sold in such manner as the old company thought fit, and the pro- ceeds paid over to the dissenting stock- holder, where the statute provided that the interest of dissenting stockholders should be ascertained by arbitration.

			stock of the now corporation in payment for their interest in tile old woulil b in olfect to compel theon to join tho new corporation, or, what is tlho s8nle tiling, compel them to consent to a consolidation.&#x0027; A well-considered case in the United States circuit court of appeals, however, takes a dilferent view of the law and holds that whore one railroad company is authorized by staltute to sell its railroad lroperty and franchises to another company, it may receive in payment tilerofor shares of stock in the vendoo company, and its stockholders are obliged to accept such payment in stock&#x0027;. This conclusion is certainly logical and puts all the stockholders on the satimo basis, although it is open to tile objection that it forces dis- senting stockholders into a now enterprise and business which they may not have contemplated. On the other hand, if dissent- ing stockholders must be paid in cash, another difficulty arises. The only way to ascertain the real value of tle property, if the sale is to a new corporation, in which a majority of the old stockhold- ers are interested, is by a public sale of the property. The dissent- ing stockholders may insist upon this, in such a case. The supremo court of the United States has so decided. The majority stock- holders have no right, upon dissolution, to sell the corporate prop- &#x0027; E.v pJar&#x0027; Bagshaw. L. It. 4 E.. 341 (1807); MloCurdy v. Myers, 44 Pa.

Asinglle stockholder may enjoin his company from selling substantially all it- property to another compalny for sharesof stock in the latter. Carter v.

A dissent- ing stockholdermayenjoin aNewJersey street railway company from selling its property to another street railway com- pany in exchange for stock of the latter, unless such sale is made in connection with dissolution proceedings. He may enjoinasaleof the property toaWashing- ton street railway company for twenty thousand sharesof the full-paid stock of the latter, wherodissenting stockholders of the former are to be paid only$35 cash in lieu of each share of the Washington corloration, which he would be entitled to. On iti face this is an issue of the
			Washington stook at $35 pershare.and is in violation of the Washington statutes. The court said: " To the extent of sixty- five per cent. of the issue the increase of capitalstock willbe, therefore,&#x0027; fictitious&#x0027; and,accordingto the constitution. &#x0027;void.&#x0027; Such a scheme ought not to be forced upon an unwilling stockholder of the New Jersey company." Moreover, it be- ing illegal in Washington for one corpio- ration to own stock in another corpora- tion,a New Jersey corporation cannot le- gally own stock in a Washington street railway company. Coler v. Tacoma Ry. etc., 54 Atl. Rep. 413 (N. J. 1903). Where the statute authorizes corporations to consolidate, a stockholder cannot object thercto on the ground that he is given stock in the consolidated company in- stead of cash, and even though the au- thorizedcapitalstockof the consolidated company is much larger than that of the constituent company and no provision has been madeforthe issueof the balance.

			erty to a now corporation for stock in the latter, and then say to the minority, "We have formedl a new company to conduct the business of this old corporation, and we have fixed the value of the shares of the old corporation. We propose to take the whole of it and pIayyou for your slares at that valuation, unless you come into the new corporation, talcing shares in it in payment of your shares in the old one." L At the public sale the maljority stock- holders may buy in tlhe property; but they have no right to buy it at private sale at a price which they themselves put upon it. Where, however, the price is a fair one, and all stockholders are allowed to participate, it is not likely that a court would order a public sale, there being no tangible prospect of benefit from such a public sale.&#x0027; As to a sale of the corporate property for purchase- money bonds in payment, this is equivalent to a sale for money payable in tile future, and hence the transaction is not open to the same objections as in the case of stock. Actual fraud, however, will of course always invalidate such a sale.4 Frequently the stat- utes provide for buying out dissenting minority stockholders at the appraised value of their stock.2 Such a statute exists in New York." Sometimes a more formal condemnation is authorized.7 1 Mason v. Pewabio Min. Co., 133 U. S. 50 (1800). The result of this Pewabio Mining Company litigation was that the original sale of the property for $50,000 was set aside, and the property then sold for $710,000. See Mason v. Pewabic Min.

In this case tie usual and simple process of one company selling all its property to the other company, and taking purchase-money mortgage bonds in payment, and then distributing the bonds among its stock- holders, was not adopted, but the mort- gage was given by the vendor company, the object being not to have the mort- gage cover existing property of the venuee company. The vendee company at the same time agreed to construct new lines and place them under the mortgage. The whole scheme was awkward, and was sustained by the courts only after prolonged litigation. In a suit to compel stockholders of a foreign corporation to discover and ac- count for corporate property illegally divided among them, the property must be definitely described. Service on the corporation by publication is insuffi- cient. King v. Sullivan, 03 Ga. 021 (1894).

			The rules above laid down are applicable in most respects to a sale by a lpnrtnership of all its property to a corporation in ox. change for stock. Such sales often are mado in order to merge a solvent copartnership into a corporation. They are also made sometimes by an embarrassed or insolvent firm. In such a case the &#x0027;creditors cf the firm may object. They may levy an attach- ment or execution on the property,&#x0027; or reach the stock,&#x0027; or file a bill in equity to set the sale aside.&#x0027; I Booth v. Bunco, 33 N.

App. Div. 100 (1807), the court refused to set aside a transfer of all tle assets of an In- solvent partnership to a corporation for stool, Iinasmuch as the cred- itors of t!he partnerslip would&#x0027; so- cure moro by having the transactlon stand tliha set aside.

Where a corporation is formed to make advances to an insolvent copartnership, t.aking a lien on the property of the latter, and the latter continues the business in its own name and turns over the proceeds of the sales to the former, the scheme is illegal as giving the firm a false credit and as being in- consistent with the nature of a chattel mortgage. Mathews v. Hardt, 87 N. Y. Misc. Rep. 653 (1902). A deed of land to a corporation for stock will not be set eside at the instance of creditors of
			the grantor where the corporation has other property and took the property in question In good faiith, oven though the grantor imlnodiately transferred the stock to his relatives. Shumakor v.

The other cred- itors cannot sot aside the transfer as being in fraud of creditors where the corporation owned other property also and was organ- ized in good faith. The creditors, however, may reach any such stock which the debtor has fraudulently disposed of.&#x0027; sold. Cass v. Sutherland, 08 Wis. 551 (1808).

Where partnership assets are transferred to a corporation in pay- ment for its stock, and the corporation pays part of the debts of the partner- ship and becomes insolvont, a member of the partnership who individually gave security for some of the partner- ship debts cannot claim a lien on the corporate assets in priority to corporate creditors.

Hamill ton, 107 Wis. 112 (1000). An Insolvent partnerlsilp may transfer Its property toa orporatiol in uxohlngo for stock anl tl:iet give tlh, stock to certain of its croditors. Such a transaction is merely a method of giving a preference Allowablo at common law. Troy v. orse, 233 Wash. 280 (100). Wheor preferences by an insolvent debtor are allowed, uchl insolvent debtor may turn over his property to a corporation In oxclhange for stock of the latter and may transfer such stock to one of his creditors, it being proved that this was a good busin"ss move and that no prop. erty was covered up thereby. Scripps v. Crawford, 123 Mlich. 17J (1000). Where an insolvent person transfers all his property to a corporation in ex- change for its stock nnd then pledges the stock to a few of his creditors, the transfer is a preterence within the meaning of the bankruptcy act, and may be set aside, and is also illegal at common law where the transfer was intended to place the stock beyond the reach of his creditors. Allen t. French, 180 Mass. 487 (1901). A transfer by an insolvent person of all his property to a corporation for stock is not fraudu- lent as a matter of law, and where it was done with the krowledge of all his creditors, and the stock was then with their knowledge transferred to a per- son who guaranteed payment of the debts to the extent of thirty-five per cent., a single creditor who stands dut for fifty per cent. will not be allowed to set aside the transfer. Kingman &#x0026; Co. v. Mowry, 182 Il. 256 (1899). But where such assignment was not in good faith a judgment creditor may cause it to be set a&#x0027;ide. Hinkley v. Reed, 182 I11. 440 (1899).

See § 006, supra. I Gray t National Steamship Co, 115 U. S. 116 (1885). Even though a corpo- ration transfers all Its property to an- other corporation on a contract made prior to incorporation of the latter, yet the latter is not liable unless it ac- cepted the property with knowledge of the contract and upon .n express or implied undertaling to carry it out. Holyoke, etc. Co. v. United States, etc. Co., 65 N. E. Rep. 54 (Mass. 1902).

Kelly v. Biddle, 180 Mass. 147 (1901). A corporation cannot be a part- ner, and hence where two corporations carry on the business jointly in an as- sumned name the assets belong one-.half to each. Geurinok v.

			tion as administrator, however, cannot defeat it by alleging that the corporation was not authorized to act as suoh.&#x0027; The charter of the corporation may, however, expressly authorize it to act as executor or trustee. But where the statutes of a state provide that no foreign corporation shall transact business which a dlomestic cor- poration cannot transact, and domestic corporations are not hllowed to act as executors, a foreign corporation cannot act as such in the state.2
			As to trusts the rule is not so rigid. The old rule that corpora- tions could not take property in trust for the use of others is now ob- solete.3 A corporation may be a trustee to hold property in trust for purposes within the corporate power.4 If a corporation be incom- petent to act as trustee, the devise or grant will not thereby be- come void; a court of equity will appoint a proper trustee to carry out and execute the trust.4 It is no defense to an action by a bondholder to reach a sinking fund that the corporation holding the fund had no charter right to act as custodian, and that such custodian had illegally guaranteed the bonds.0
			§ ó80. Stockholder&#x0027;s right to prevent the corporation from utller- tal;ing a new bustiness.- It is ultra vires of a corporation to under- take to carry on a business which is not fairly within the scope of the business described in its charter. When such an attempt is made on the part of the directors or a majority of the stockholders, a dissenting stockholder may insist upon the corporate business being confined to the limits of the corporate charter; and he may enjoin or set aside any acts which do not conform to those limits. 1 Union, etc. Co. v.

			Although an educational institution is operating a ferry withont power so to do, yet, if a person is injured by the ferry, the institu- tion is liable in damages.1
			Where the lessee of a car-company plant repudiates the lease on the ground of ultra vires and refuses to pay rent, and the court holds that it cannot be compelled to pay rent, the lessor company may compel the lessee to pay for the property so taken, including the value of the contracts taken over.&#x0027;
			A corporation receiving goods ultra vires to sell on commission is nevertheless liable for breach of contract as to the price of the sale.8
			An iron and steel manufacturing company has no power to oper- ate a public or private warehouse. Hence warehouse receipts issued by the corporation on its own property are not protected like the ordinary warelouse receipts, and corporate creditors who hold such receipts are not protected thereby, and the transaction may not amount to a pledge.9 1 Chippewa, etc. Ry. v.

S. 138 (1898), the court held that, where a lease of prop- erty was ultra vires and void, the only compensation for the actual use would be for the tangible property, and not
			for the good-will, patents. and contracts which expired during .the lease. Ac- cordingly, where the stipulated rental was $204,000 a year, the lower court al- lowed for use the value of the capital stock of the lessor, inasmuch as such value had been consumed in connection with the lease, cnd such value was fixed at upwards of $2,500,000 and interest, but the supreme court reduced the compensation to $727,000 and interest, being the actual value of the tangible property.

			Tlhe courts differ widely in their decisions on the enforcoability of tlltrit vire.s contracts. The New York court of appeals, in a series of consistent and ably-reasoned decisions, has established the rulo in that state that an ultra viru contract is enforceable if there has been part performance and the stockholders havo not objected and the creditors have not been injured.&#x0027; The Now York court says that" that kind of plunder which hol(di on to the property, but pleads the (loctrine of ultra vires against the obligation to pay for it, has no recognition or support in the law of this state."2
			Plractically the snelo conclusion has been reached in Massachu- setts &#x0027; aun Wisconsin.4
			In tile federal courts, on the contrary, tile old rule against ultra vi&#x0027;;&#x0027;. contracts is upheld in all its rigor and applied with all its severity. Tile tendency of modern jurisprudence to relax on that subject finds no favor in the federal courts. tin r. Niagara, etc. Co., 122 N. Y. 165 (1800). I Whitney Arms Co. v. Barlow. 03 N. Y. 62 (187.); Martin v. Niagara, etc. Co., 122 N. Y. 105 (1800); Bath Oas Light Co. v. Classy, 151 N. Y. 24, 20-134, 37 (1800), per Andrews, Ch. J., review- ing many cases, discussing the subject in an able and exhaustive manner, and holding that past-due rent may be re- covered on an ultra vires lease. 2Seymour v. Spring Forest Cem. Assoc., 144 N. Y. 333, 841 (1805); s. C., 157 N. Y. 607. 3Chief Justice Bigelow, in Brown v. Winnisimmet Co., 03 Mass 326. 334 (1865), said: "We know of no rule or principle by which an act creating a corporation for certain specific objects, or to carry on a particular trade or business. is to be strictly construed as prohibitory of all other dealings or transactions not coming within the exact scope of those designated." In Nims a. Mount Hermon Boys&#x0027; School, 160 Mass. 177 (1893). the court said that an ultra rires contract not yet executed will not be enforced by the courts: but, "on the other hand, courts have fre- quently held that while such contracts, considered merely as contracts, are in- valid, they involve no such element of moral or legal wrong as to forbid their
			enforcement, if there has been such ac- tion under them as to work injustice if they are set aside. Courts have been astute to discover something in the nature of an equitable estoppol against one who, aftei entering into such a con- tract, and inducing a change of condi- tion byanother party, attempts to avoid the contract by a plea of ultra vires. It is said that such a plea will not avail when to allow it would work injustice and accomplish legal wrong." The court, however, declined to pass upon this principle of law. 4 The old rule of ultra tires has been changed so that now only the state or a party interested in the corporation can complain. Farwell Co. v. Wolf, 96 Wis 10 (1807).
			a "The doctrine of ultra vires, by which a contract made by a corporation beyond the scope of its corporate pow- ers is unlavful and void, and will not support an action, rests, as this court has often recognized and affirmed, upon three distinct grounds: the obligation of any one contracting with a corpora- tion to take notice of the legal limits of its powers; the interest of the stock- holders not to be subject to risks which they have never undertaken; and, above all, the interest of the public that the corporation shall not transcend the 1008

In a dictum in Jacksonville, etc. Nav. Co. v. Hooper, 160 U.

A director in a bank is personally liable to persons who deposit their money in the bank after lie knows, that it is hopelessly insolvent, where he fails to initiate mIeasures to close the business of the bank.4
			Whore the corporation has power to do a certain act, but does not authorize a person or officer to do that act, then tile person or olliccr doing such act is liable personally therefor. IIo is liable as an unauthorized agent.5

An unsecured creditor of a solvent corporation that hlls trans- ferred all its property to another corpo- ration for stock of the latter, and such stock is then sold to pay a mortgage debt, cannot hold the agents of the cor- poration carrying out the transaction personally liable for misapplication of funds, the transaction having been au- thorized and directed by the board of directors of the selling corporation. Wingv. Charleroi, etc. Co., 112 Fed. Rep. 817 (1902). Even though an insolvent person sells all his property to a corpo- ration and the corporation proceeds with the business, yet the directors are not personally liable on the transfer being set aside, where they acted in good faith. Re Ely, 82 L. T. Rep. 501 (1900). 4 It is his duty to call a meeting of the directors, or report the condition of things to the state authorities, or in- struct the cashier to stop taking de-

Directors who have been obliged to repay money which they, and others received for turning over tile assets of the company to another company, they having no interest which could legally be the subject of such sale,cannot recover back from such other persons the amount paid by, the latter.

			riglt to do business in the various states - Restrictions thereon. § 683. Intra vires acts as distinistinegisd from ultra vires acts.- An ultra vires act, as already explained, is an act beyond the ex- press and&#x0027;implied powers of the corporation. An intra vires act, on the contrary, is one which is within the express or implied pow- ers either of the board of directors or of the majority of the stock- holders in mneeting assembled. Intra vires acts are frequently spoken of as matters concerning the "internal management" of the corporation. Much confusion has arisen concerning these acts, owing to a failure to recognize clearly the fact that an act is intra vires of a corporation if it can be legally carried out either by the directors or by the majority of the stockholders. Thus, a stockholder fre- quently brings suit to enjoin or set aside an act which the majority of the stockholders have power to do, but which the directors have done without power. It is clear that a dissenting stockholder has no right to carry such a matter into the courts unless the majority are also opposed to the act, since, if the majority approve of the directors&#x0027; acts, this amounts to a ratification of the same.
			In short, there are three classes of corporate acts herein. First, the stockholder may bring suit to remedy an act which is ultra vires, or beyond the powers of both the majority of the stockholders

			and of tile directors.? Second, as to acts within the power of the majority of tlo stockhlolders, but beyond the power of the directors, at stockholder may sue to enjoin or set tlhel aside when the direct- ors have performed them, and tile majority or tilo stockholders re- fuse to conlirm their action.&#x0027; As to such acts tile stockholder cannot sue if tlh majority conlirm the directors in their performance. Third, as to acts within the powers of the directors and performed hy thom, or within the powers of the majority of the stockholders and performed by the majority, the stockholders cannot complain that they are ultra vires. The second and third classes of acts are -in tra vires of the corporation. They are matters of internal arrange- ment or management, and cannot be controlled or objected to by a minority stockholder, except as&#x0027;stated above.a The question of what int Ia vires acts are to be performed by the directors, and what ones can be exorcised only by the majority of the stockholders in meeting assembled, is considered elsewhere.4
			§ 084-. &#x0027;Th, discretion of the dtirectors or a lnm(ority of the stock- holders as to acts intra&#x0027; vires ccnnot be questioned by! single stoclc- holders unlessfraud i iinolved.?-- This proposition of law is clearly, firmly, and very properly estalJlished beyond any question. Were 1 Chapter XL: supra, treats of this subject. See also § 740, infra. 2 Exeter, ewc. Ry. v. Buller, 11 Jur., Part I, 527, 533 (1847), holding also that where such an action has been insti- tuted it will not be defeated by the fact that subsequently the directors obtain control of a majority of the votes. But there must be clear proof that the ma- jority refuse to conlirm. Thus. in Bag- shaw v. Eastern Union Ry., 7 Hare, 114 (1849), the court says that Soss v. Har- bottle, 2 Hare. 401 (1843), decides "that if the act, though it be the act of the directors only, be one which a general meetingof the company could sanction, a bill by some of the shareholders, on behalf of themselves and others. to im- peach that act, cannot be sustained, be- cause a general meeting of the com- pany might immediately confirm and give validity to the act of which the bill complains." See also MacDougall v. Gardiner, L. R. 1 Ch. D. 13 (1875), and § 062, supra. Acts intri r ires may be ratified by a majority of the stock- holders and the minority cannot com-
			plain. Bassett v. Fairchild, 132 Cal. 037 (1901). 3 See note 5 below. 4 See ch. XLIII, infra. 5 Quoted and approved in MoMullen v. Ritchie, 04 Fed. Rep. 253 (1894). "A stockholder cannot enjoin the execu- tion of a contract intra vires unless fraud is shown." Burden v. Burden, 15 .N. Y. 287. 307 (1899). "Ques- tions of policy of management, of ex- pediency of contracts or action, of adó- quacy of consideration not grossly dis- proportionate, of lawful appropriation of corporate funds to advance corporate interests, are left solely to the honest decision of the directors, if their pow- ers are without limitation and free from restraint. To hold otherwise would be to substitute the judgment and dis- cretion of others in the place of those determined on by the scheme of incor- poration." Ellerman v. Chicago Junc- tion, etc. Co., 49 N. J. Eq. 217 (1891). Thus, in Bloxam v. Metropolitan Ry., L R. 3 Ch. App. 837 (1868), the court said: "The matters of internal arrangement 1021 Of. XyL.]

			ness. A partner in a copartnership may prevent action which ho (lisapproves, but corporations lare formed very largely to avoid tlat very danger and disadvantage. The corporato directors, so long as they act within their powers, may use their own discretion as to what ought to be (lone. Such also is tile rule with the majority of tlo stockholders in mooting assembled. An act intra( vires and witlout fraud is an act of internal management, and a minority of the stockholders are powerless to prevent, control, change, or ques- tion that act.1 Thus, a stockholder has no remedy for tile mere inel- ficiency of a director, except to turn him out at tho next election of the corporation. Having once been elected, a director is entitled to retain his position, even though le is grossly ineillcient. IIo cannot ho removed from his position.2 But whore there are vio- lent internal dissensions in a corporation, and two sets of olllcers are attempting to act, and the corporate prolpety is enlangered, a court of equity will interfere to the extent of preserving tile cor- porate property by a temporary receiver.&#x0027; A court of equity can- not, however, restrain the corporation from proceeding with bust- ness and using its funds for that purpose, even though a minority of the stockholders show thht sound business discretion and judg- ment would dictate a different policy.&#x0027; The question of whether a suit by a corporation shall be broughllt or not is entirely within the discretion of the directors, in the absence of fraud.&#x0027; Thus, even though a railroad is giving a lower rate to one customer than to another, yet a stockholder cannot maintain a suit of injunction to compel the party to pay what he should have paid. While the act to purchase stock in other corporations, the corporation may subscribe for stock in another corporation to be formed to carry on a similar business, and the court will not, at the instance of a stockholder. review the discretion of the directors in making such invest- nment. Rubino v. Pressed, etc. Co., 53 Atl. Rep. 1050 (N. J. 1903). 1 Quoted and approved in Symmes v. Union Trust Co., 00 Fed. Rep. 830 (1894). 2See 711, infra. 3Trade Auxiliary Co. v. Vickers, L. R 16 Eq. 303 (1873); Featherstone v. Cooke, L.

			that it is impossible to carry on the business with advantage to the parties interested. In such a case the court will interfere, but only for a limited time, and to as small an extent as possi- ble." See also Lawrence v. Greenwich F. Ins.

A stockholder may object to corporate acts and contracts which are fraudulent or ultra vires or mala in sc. But all other acts le can correct only by the election of new directors. Leslie v.

In most cases the business of a corpora- tion is to invest and use its capital, and not to loan it out. Accord- ingly, it is well settled that only where the business of the corpo- ration. is such as usually involves loaning does the corporation have tile right to loan its funds.3 If not prohibited by statute, a corpo- ration may receive and sell notes or acceptances, if this is naturally connected with its business.4 But unless specially authorized they lAnderson v.

Even though a Connecticut corporation which owns a railroad in Kentucky is being wound up, in accordance with the statutes of Connecticut, and even though the company has assigned to the statutory recc!-"r in Connecticut all its property, yet such an assignment is not an assignment for the benefit of cred- itors and hence a creditor of the rail- road may attach in Kentucky assets in

Whero the controlling directors of two corporations are thiu sairn persons, anut one company becomes liable on paper for the accommodation of the other, and thereby renders the direct- ors of tie former personally liable for breach of trust, a mortgage given by the latter to the former as security for such paper is invalid, because it amounts to a preference to suhol oll- cors. utchinson tv Sutton Mfg. Co., 57 Fed. Rep. 998 (1803), a case arising in Indiana. An attaching creditor cannot attack a corporate conveyance which operates as a preference, the corpora- tion itself being insolvent, inasmuch as the reason against preferences by an insolvent corporation applies as much to attaching creditors as to parties tak- ing by conveyance. Walker v. Miller, 50 Fed. Rep. 869 (1894). A statutory as- Mignment by a Minnesota corporation to another Minnesota corporation does not prevent a subsequent attachment in Massachusetts by a citizen of New York who is a creditor of the insolvent Minnesota corporation to reach assets of the latter in 1Massachusetts, even though the New York creditor had no- tice of the assignment, but had not proven his claim nor filed a release therein. Security T. Co. v. Dodd, Mead &#x0026; Co., 173 U. S. 024 (1899). In this case the court stated that common-law as- signments were different and would be respected. except so far as they con- flicted with the rights of local cred-

Section 5242 of the Revised Statutes of the United States prohibits a national bank front transferring any notes, bonds. bills of. exchange, or other evi- dences of debt or mortgages or judg- melnt or deposits either after an act of insolvency or in contemplation thereof with a view to a preference. The fol- lowing decisions are on this statute: National Security Bank tr Butler, 120 U. S. 223 (1889), nls&#x0027;g 22 Fed. Rep. 0097, where a bank holding a certificate of deposit of an insolvent bank took as- sets of the latter on the day of its fail. ure, and gave a certificate of deposit therefor, and then souglt to offset the one against the other. The court held that it was immaterial that the creditor of the insolvent bank &#x0027;was not aware of the insolvency. Roberts v. Hill, 24 Fed. Rep. 571 (1885), rev&#x0027;g a c., 23 Fed. Rep. 311, where a bank trans- ferred to one of its depositors a note which the bank held, the transfer be- ing made when the bank was insolvent. Although the bank kept open for about three months thereafter, and even though the note was given to the de- positor as collateral security, and was the only way of preventing him from drawing out his money, the court held that the act was in contemplation of insolvency, inasmuch as the officers could reasonably see that the bank would presently be unable to meet its obligatidn, and would be obliged to suspend operations. Case v. Citizens&#x0027; Bank, 2 Woods, 23 (1873); a c, 5 Fed. Cas. 251, in which an insolvent bank transferred various bills and notes to another bank, to which the former bank had, while solvent, transferred bills of exchange which were not there- after honored.

PSecln astatute did not invalidate an assignment for the benefit of creditors given by an in- solvent New Jersey corporation in Pennsylvania. Borton v. Brines-Chase Co., 175 Pa. St. 200 (1810). A mortgage given by an insolvent corporation to a creditor for a preexisting debt is in- valid under the New Jersey statutes. Frost v. Barnert, 56 N. J. Eq. 290 (1897). The proper way to attack a preference given by an insolvent corporation is in the distribution proceedings in a suit to have the company declared insolv- ent, and a receiver appointed, and its assets distributed. A warrant of at- torney to confess judgment given in September and used in February is evi- dence of an intent to give a preference if existing notes are taken up and new notes given at the time of entry of judgment. Consolidated Coal Co. .: National St. Bank, 55 N. J. Eq. 800. (1807). At common law insolvent cor- porations may assign for the benefit of creditors. Wilkinson v. Bauerle, 41 N. J.

Eq. 018 (1880); Willtlnsol v. Bauerle, 41 N. J. Eq. 035 (1880ó A chattel mortgage limado in contempt of court and in violation of the statutes against preferences by a corporation is void. Bissell i. Bosson, 47 N. J. Eq. 580 (1800). See also Borgen v. Porpoise Fishing Co., 42 N. J. Eq. 307 (1880). Under the old New Jersey stat- ute tile directors of a corporation might mortgage the property and issue bonds to themselves as security for previous advancements, even though the com- pany was insolvent. Whittaker v. Am. well Nnt. Bank, 52 N. J. Eq. 400 (1804). It is a disposal of property for the pur- pose of hindoring and delaying credit- or, within the meaning of the second section of the statute of frauds, for an insolvent firm to mortgage all their property to a trustee and take the bonds secured by that mortgage, even though they take the bonds to turn over to their creditors But the act is voidable only as to those creditors who object and contest the matter. National Bank v. Sprague, 21 N. J. Eq. 530 (1870). Al- though New York corporations are for- bidden by the statutes of New York to execute mortgages or give preferences in contemplation of insolvency, yet a mortgage given by a New York corpo- ration on chattels and real estate in New Jersey was upheld in New Jersey, although made in contemplation of in- solvency. The New Jersey courts did not apply the New York law, but will apply that of New Jersey. The debt secured by the mortgage in this case was payable in New Jersey, however, and most of the creditors resided there. Boelhme t. Rail, 51 N. J. Eq. 541 (1803). A levy of execution prior to the ap- pointment of a receiver has a prior claim on the assets levied upon. Van Steenberg v. Parsil, etc. Co., 84 AtL Rep. 135 (N. J. 1800). An insolvent New Jersey corporation cannot as against
			some of its creditors issue mortgage bonds to other creditors Skirin v. Eastern, etc. Co., 07 N. J. Eq. 170 (1808). A mortgage mado by the president without authority is not binding on the company and&#x0027;cannot be validated after the company has become insolvent where the statute prohibits assignmonts after insolvency. Howell v. Keen, 43 Atl. Rep. 1070 (N. J. 1800).
			&#x0027;etw York: In New York, from 1825 to 1802, the statutes prohibited corpo- rations from making any transfers or assignments in contemplation of in- solvency, and declared any such trans- sers and assignments utterly void. (1 R S. S 03, § 4.) By this statute all as- signments by New York corporations for the benefit of creditors were held to be void. Sibell v. Remsen, 88 N. Y. 05 (1805): National,eto. Bank v. Mechanics&#x0027; Nat. Bank, 80 N. Y. 407 (1882); Harris v. Thompson, 15 Barb. 02 (1853); Atkinson v Rochester Printing Co., 114 N. Y. 108 (1880). The following decisions were as to what was meant by "in contemplation of insolvency:" In Robinson v. Bank of Attica, 21 N. Y. 400 (1800), where a state bank, three days before its failure, in- duced a party to give it accommodation checks, and on the following day turned out securities to secure such checks, the court held that the securities could be recovered back by the receiver. In Marine Bank v. Clements, 81 N. Y. 33 (1805), wlhere an insolvent corporation assigned a note to a party, and that party brought suit upon the note, the court held that the maker of the note could not set up the insolvency as a de- sense, there being no proof that the in- dorsee did not give value at the time he took the note from the insolvent corpo- ration. In Dutcher v. Importers&#x0027;, etc. Nat. Bank, 50 N. 2&#x0027;. 5 (1874), the court held that where the bank paid a check to a depositor who had no knowledge of 1688 § 001.]

			INTRlA VIlliBE ACTS AND OONTRAOTS.
			[§ 001. subject. Although a state cannot give a preference to its own cit. izons as against citizens of another state in the distribution of the the insolvency of the bank, this was not such a preference as was prohibited by the statute. In Paulding v. Chrome Steel Co., 04 N. Y. 834 (1884), although a chattel mortgage had been given five yoears before the company became in. solvent, and hadnot been recorded, and was renewed and recorded at the time whon the corporation was insolvent, yet the court held that the mortgage was valid. Under the New York act a director cannot obtain a preference by attoachment, nor by a judgment taken by default. Throop v. Hatch Lithog. Co., 125 N. Y. 530 (1801). In 1890 the above statute was changed so that as- signmon ts by insolvent corporations are now legal, provided no preferences are given. (Stook Corporation Law, § 48.) Preferences given to any creditor, whether a corporate officer, or stock- holder, or outsider, are void. A chattel mortgage given by an insolvent Michi- gan corporation to a trustee for the benefit of all creditors who should ac- cept its terms and extend their debts, the trustee being given power to con- tinue the business, is not valid as to personal property in New York state, even though recorded as a chattel mort- gage in New York state. Dearing v. McKinnon, etc. Co., 165 N. Y. 78 (1900). An assignment of personal property by an insolvent corporation for the benefit of such of its creditors as accept the same, one of the provisions being that they should extend the time of pay- ment of their claims, is illegal under the statute of frauds in New York, in that it delays and hinders the creditors in obliging them to extend the time of payment and in that the assignee was authorized to sell on credit. The fact that such an instrument was legal in Michigan, where the corporation ex- isted, did not legalize the instrument as to personal property in Netw York state. Dearing v. McKinnon, etc. Co., 83 N. Y.
			App. Div. 81 (1808) The New York statute does not render invalid a judg. mont obtained by a corporate creditor by default for failure to answer. Lopoz v. Campbell, 108 N.Y. 840 (1900). Where an insolvent corporation has illegally transforrod its property. a permanent receiver may bring a suit at law for conversion Instead of suing in a court of equity. McQueen v. New, 45 N. Y. App. Div. 679 (18009 A judgment ob. tained by collusion with the president may bean illegal preference. Rossman v. Seaver, 41 N. Y. App. Div. 003 (1800). Where a cc rporation Is formed to mako advances to an insolvent copartnership, taking a lien on the property of the latter, and the latter continues the business in its own name and turns over the proceeds of the sales to the former, the scheme is illegal as giving the firm a false credit and as being in- consistent with the nature of a chattel mortgage. Mathews v. Hardt, 37 N. E. Misc. Rep. 053 (1902). In Baker v. Em- erson,4 N. Y. App. Div. 348 (18900), where a rpanufacturingcompany, beinginsolv- ent, paid a note for $3,000, leaving $17,000 of debts unpaid, payment being made May 29, 1893, and the company suspended business June 5, 1893, the court held that the payment was ille- gal, although the company expected at the time of the payment to raise suffi- cient money to go on with its business; citing to this effect, Vennard v. McCon- nell, 93 Mass. 555, 502 (1866); also Sorbes v. Howe, 102 Mass. 427, 436 (1869). A preference to a partnership of which a stockholder is a member is illegal. Jones v. Blun, 145 N. Y. 333 (1895). An assignment for the benefit of creditors is authorized by the directors and not the stockholders. A resolution of the board of directors that the company execute an assignment for the benefit of creditors may be carried out by the president without further authority; 309

App. Div. 282 (1897). Wlloro a private corporation, witli the consent of all its stockholders of record, agrees with its creditors that the property shall be taken chargo of by an individual and manageod for tile purpose of paiying tie debts and then returning the property to the corpora. tion, and oneof the stockholders at that time secretly transfers some of the cer. tificates of stock to his wife and sie holds the stock for three yearsand then transfers it without consideration to a party who brings suit to set aside the transaction, the court will not give such relief. Marbury v. Stone, 17 N. Y. App. Div. 352 (1897); asi&#x0027;d, 160 N. Y. 701. Thle fact that the company is unable to meet its obligations, and that judg- ments are being entered against it, shows insolvency. Nealis . American, etc. Co., 70 Hun, 220 (1894); asf&#x0027;d, 150 N. Y. 42 Even in New York, where a con- veyance in view of insolvency is void, an embarrassed corporation may mort- gage all its property to secure bonds which are given to creditors for their debts, where the creditor who refuses to take the bonds waits over three years before attacking the mortgage. New Britain Nat. Bank v. A. B. Cleve- land Co.. 91 Hun, 447 (1895); ast&#x0027;d, 158 N. Y. 722 (1899). An insolvent corporation may give a mortgage to secure bonds given at that time. if the issue is a fair business transaction and for the pur- pose of saving the company and its property. Cochran r. Anglo American, etc. Co., 09 Hun. 168 (1893). In an ac- tion hy a receiver to set aside a trans- ser of property made in violation of
			the statute, It seems tihat It Is no do- fenso that an execution sale by a third party had taken all the equity of the comlpany illithe properly. Stonebridgo v. Perkins, 111 N.Y. 1 (1894). Formerly a foreign corporation might lmakle, in New York, an assignment for the ben. eat of its creditors, whore suoll assign- ment wouldl e valid if made in the state where tlh company was incor. porated: In tills case in New Jersey. The New York statute against such as- signments applied only to a domestio corporation. At common law any cor- poration might make such an assign- ment, and the president and secretary, under authority of the board of direct- ors. might execute an assignment for tile benefit of creditors made by the corporation. Vanderpoel v. Gorman, 140 N. Y. 503 (1894). An insolvent Mas- sachusetts corporation, having goods in New York, might transfer the same to a creditor, and the transfer takes pre- cedence of all attachment subsequently levied in New York by another cred- itor. The New York act against as- signments by insolvent corporations formerly applied only to domestic cor- porations. Lane tv Wheelwright, 69 Hun, 180 (1893); asf&#x0027;d, 143 N. . 034.

			But where the corporation is insolvent an entirely different ques- tion arises. There has been a difference of opinion in the courts, poration may repay the money to himn self from the treasury when its condi. tion will permit. Stokes v. Stokes, 01 liun, 005 (1895). The president may own receivers&#x0027;certificates. MoKittrick v. Arkansas Central Ry., 113 U. S. 473 (1804).

Two years&#x0027; delay on the part of a stock- holder in complaining of a mortgage given by the corporation to raise money to pay a debt due to the president is fatal, even though the president had originally agreed to require payment only out of sales of property by the cor- poration. Wills v. Porter, 132 Cal. 510 (1001). A foreclosure is not invalid, even though some of the bonds are held by the directors. Rawlins v. New Memphis,etc. Co., 0 S.W. Rep. 200 (Tenn. 1000), holding also that a director who owns bonds may purchase the prop- erty at foreclosure sale. Stockhold- ers and directors may !oan money

			to the corporation and participate ratably as creditors upon its insolv- ency, and in insolvency proceedings the legal existence of the corporation cannot be questioned. Hooven, etc. Co., v. Evans, etc. Co., 198 Pa. St. 28 (1800). A bank director may foreclose a mort- gage given by the bank for money loaned, oven though the bank becomes insolvent after the loan was made. Millsaps v. Chapman, 70 Miss. 042 (1800). The Ohio statute prohibiting a director being interested in the purchase of bonds from his corporation at less than par does not apply to an issue of bonds to an outsider who subsequently admits a director as a partner in the trans- action. Toledo, etc. R. . u. Continental Trust Co, 95 Fed. Rep. 497 (1890). Where the trustee of a mortgage makes a loan to the mortgagor on the bonds secured by the mortgage and then sells out the collateral and buys it in him- self, he can upon foreclosure enforce the bonds only to the extent of the amount loaned and interest. Knicker- bocker Trust Co. v. Penacook Mlfg. Co., 100 Fed. Rep. 814 (1000). 1 Hence where an officer, for a loan of $100,000 to the company, takes its notes therefor and four hundred bonds as&#x0027;collateral, and twelve hundred and fifty shares of paid-up stock as a "Bonus" the court characterized the transaction as a fraud, and held that the pledge of the bonds would be dis- regarded and declared void.

In anotler decision involving the same transaction, Hart v. Globe Ins. Co., 118 Fed. Rep. 807(1882), the court hold that a decision in the state court upholding the transaction, but not bringing in all the parties, was not a bar. A transfer of property by an insolvent corporation to its directors in part pay. ment of their claims is illegal. Hill v. Standard, etc. Co., 108 Pa. St. 440 (1001). A director cannot obtain a preference, but the invalidity of his preference does not invalidate preferences to others in the same transaction. Moller v. Keystone, etc. Co., 187 Pa. St. 553 (1898). Where the board of directors allow an illegal preference to one di- rector they are personally liable to other creditors to the extent of such preference, and, even though one of them resigns, the liability continues for the benefit of past as well as future creditors.

A receiver may recover back property delivered by an insolvent corporation to its directors as a preforonce; but where the directors in order to relieve corporate property from attachment in another state take an assignment of the claims, their preference in that state out of assets In that state may be allowed. Gray v.Taylor,44 Atl. Rep. 008 (N. J. 189). A corporate mortgage by an ollicer to his wife to secure a debt due to himself from the corpora- tion is illegal. Rowe v.

Clark, 58 Neb. 183(1800).

Krauso v. Malaga, etc. Co., 18 Atl. . p. 307 (N. J. 1880). Where the board of directors borrow money on the statement that the loan is from an outsider, and it afterwards transpires that the loan was by the president and another director, a commission of twenty per cent. paid for the loan can be recovered back by the corporation.

			Where a corporation purchases a firm&#x0027;s business, it cannot legally pay a debt due by thoe frm to a director in the corporation, if such payment is Induced by such director and the corporation is insolvent. Rudd v. Robinson, 54 Hun, 830 (1880), reversed on another point in 120 N. Y. 118. If a director as a creditor takes all the corporate assets in payment of his debt, le is liable to other creditors for the difference be- tween the actual value of the property and the price at which h6 took it.

The fact that nine months elapsed before the corporation passed into a receiver&#x0027;s hands was im- material. A sale of corporate property to a director in payment of debts due him from the insolvent company can- not be objected to in a suit at law by him for the conversion of the property. The objection must be made by bill in equity. Little Rock, etc. Ry. v. Page, 35 Ark. 804 (1880). In New Jersey, by statute, a receiver is invested with all the rights of creditors.

Where the board of directors of a fail- ing corporation voted all the assets to a few of their number In payment of an antecedent debt, the transaction is fraudulent and will be set aside, even in Michigan. the directors so preferred being three-fourths of the board. Rick- erson, etc. Co. v. Farrell, etc. Co., 75 Fed. Rep. 554 (1890).

A resolution of the board of directors that the company execute an assignment for the benefit of credit- ors may be carried out by the president without further authority, but he should not select himself as assignee.

			§ 003. Pri&#x0027;fvercelccs in fraor of corlporut tct tfbts upon w1 ich the di- rectors are liable as indorsers or otliarwisc.-Wliero a director is nerely tlo indorsor, surety, or guarantor of a corporato debt or note, to which a preforonco is given by an insolvent corporation, a imucll moro dillicult question arises than whore suoh debt or noto is hloll by the director himself. &#x0027;The decisions are in conflict on this subject. Tho great weight of authority undoubtedly is that such a preferenco is illegal.T This is so hlold because, first, such a prefer- bare quorum of the directors and one or more of thell were legally incapaci- tated by being directly interested. The language of tile court was: " I can see no reason why a nmeibor of tile board of directors llight not sit in the board, and, without fraud, in conjunction with others, consent to an order for so- curllg a debt actually due to him from the corporation." A preference given by an insolvent corporation to direct- ors may be legal. The remedy of cor- porate creditors against an illegal pref- erence is by creditors&#x0027; bill and not by an execution sale. Butler v. Harrison, etc. Co., 139 Mo. 407 (187). In Missouri it is held that the directors in an in- solvent corporation may prefer their own debts, but a degree of good faitil is required which practically nullifies such preference. State t.

A stockholder cannot have a receiver ap- pointed and mortgages set aside where all the stock is " water," even though the controlling party had made the mortgages to himself and is about to sell the assets of the company to an- other company controlled by himself, and has levied an assessment on the stock of the old company in order to sell out the stock. Robinson v. Dolores, etc. Co., 3 Colo. App. 17 (1892). In Illi- nois it is held that an insolvent corpo-
			ration may prefer a creditor who is tlh fatlher of a majority of tle directors. It is also held that a preference may be given to directors for a debt contracted whilo the company was insolvent.

			Notwithstanding these decisions and reasons, there are circum- stances under which such a preference will be sustained. A cor- porate creditor is not to be punished simply because the directors have guaranteed his claim. The supreme court of the United States ains strongly intimated that such is the law;&#x0027; and indeed it Bsame persons, and one company bo- comes liable on paper for the accommo- dation of the other, and thereby ren- ders the directors of the former person- ally liable for broach of trust, a mort- gage given by the latter to the former as security for such paper is invalid, be- cause it amounts to a preference to such oficers.

But a corporate dreditor who advised the directors to take a mort- gage from the corporation to secure them in their indorsement of corporate paper cannot afterwards object to such mortgage. ie Bloomfield, etc. Mills, 101 Iowa, 181 (1897). A corporation in financial difficulties cannot execute a mortgage to secure bonds, and deliver these bonds to a bank as security for past and future advances, where two of the directors of the company are also directors of the bank. Such a mortgage delays other creditors. Only

Even though the president has personally given se- curity for a loan to a corporation, the lender may obtain a judgment against the corporation, and even though by agreement the security is sold and the money deposited as security for the judgment, this does not constitute pay- ment so far as the statutory liability of stockholders is concerned.

An in- solvent corporation in North Carolina may confess judgment to a creditor for whose debt the president is surety. Howard v. Central, etc. Co., 123 N. C. 00 (1808). In Georgia it is held that where the directors are guarantors of a note secured by mortgage and the note is not paid, they may take an as- signment of the note and mortgage and enforce the mortgage, even though the corporation might possibly pay the debt if time were given. Rylander v. Sheffield, 108 Ga. 111 (1809). An in- solvent corporation may give a prefer- ence to a note which is indorsed by a di- rector where the company received the money for the note and the indorsement was for accommodation. Nat. Bank, etc. v. George, etc. Co., 18 Utah. 400 (1898). The payment and securing of a corporate debt are not fraudulent merely because some of the directors
			had guaranteed the debt, Taylor County Court v. Baltimore, etc. .I R., 113 Sod. Rep. 101 (1888). A chattel mort- gage securing a part of the creditors of an &#x0027;inolvent corporation may be valid althoughl some of the directors and stolckholdurs who voted for the mortgage are guarantors and indorsers of the debts so secured. Brown v. G rand Rapids, etc. Co., 58 Fed. Rep. 280 (1803), following the Mlichigan decisions, and stating that the supreme court of the United States has not decided that a corporation may not prefer one of its directors. A creditor may be preferred by the givingof security by an insolvent corporation, even though his claim is secured by the directors and stockhold. ers, lie not knowing of the insolvency at the time of the giving of the security. Henderson t. Indiana Trust Co., 143 Ind. 501 (1895). An insolvent corporation may give a mortgage to a creditor, by way of preference, even though a di- rector is surety on the debt. Waggoner, etc. Co. v. Ziegler, etc. Co., 128 Mo. 473 (1895). A mortgage to a creditor on part of the property of an insolvent cor- poration is legal, although some of the stockholders and directors are indorsers of the debt. Weilhl v. Atlanta, etc. Co., 89 Ga. 297 (1892). In Arkansas it is held that an insolvent corporation may pre- ser certain creditors, even though their claim is secured by the indorsements of the directors. Worthen r. Griffith, 59 Ark. 560 (1804). In Milledgeville Bank- ing Co. v. McIntyre Alliance Store, 08 Ga. 503 (1800), the court very properly held that a mortgage given by an insolv- ent corporation to an outside creditor was valid, although the directors had given their personal note as additional security for the debt, such note being purely an accommodation note.

			the director or from tho corporation itself at a time when tile cor- poration was solvent; or whero tile corlorate creditor (lid not know that the corporation was insolvent wheli he acquired his claim from the director or from tile corporation itself; or where the corporate creditor loaned money to a corporation itself when it was insolvent, and at the same time received a mnortgage by way of preference, and also obtained the indorsements of the lireotors on his paper; or where the directors were merely indorsors for the accommnoda- tion of the corporation. It is true that the above rules would enable a corporation to give preference to a corporate creditor in nost cases where a director is indorser or gunrantor of the claim. But, on the other hand, it is now a general custom in banking circles not to loan to a business corporation unless the directors guarantee the debt. If the law puts such a debt at a disadvantage as com- pared with other corporate debts, the credit of business corpora- tions will be greatly curtailed, thereby rendering insolvent many corporations which otherwise would be able to extricate them- selves from their troubles. In New Jersey the ingenious rule has been sustained that where a preference has been given by an insolvent corporation to debts guaranteed by the directors, the amount realized from such preference, over and above what would have been realized if there had been no preference, may be recov- ered by the other creditors from the directors.&#x0027;

A director who votes for a preference on debts for which other directors are liable cannot complain. Lucas v. Friant, 111 Mich. 426 (1897). Although a mortgage is ~n- valid as to the debts in which the di- rectors are interested, it may be valid as to the emlnining debts secured by it. Savage v. Miller, 56 N. J. Eq: 438 (1898). A preference is legal although some of the directors voting therefor were sure- ties on the paper to which such prefer- ence is given, their votes not being necessary. Levering v. Bimel. 146 Ind. 545 (1897). Where a mortgage is given by an insolvent corporation to secure an antecedent debt for which a director is surety, the mortgage is not neces. sarily illegal; but if the transaction is actually a scheme to give the director a preference, it is illegal. Atlas Tack Co. v. Macon Hardware Co., 101 Ga. 891

			[§ 04. ent rule prevails in Pennsylvaniu.&#x0027; In that state tilo mortmain laws are hold to still exist, and tile state itself ihas enactcd a statute restricting the riglt.
			In the other states, however, tie rule is firmly cstablished that the right of a domestic corporation to purchnse and hold land can be questioned only by a stockholder or by the state in a direct pro. enforce spoolilo performance of the contract. Eastern Counties Ry. v. Hawlkos, 0 IL I. Cas. 131 (1855). Fre- quently the charter places some linita. tions or grants some privileges herein. A charter power to hold land for busi- ness purposes and to secure debts does not authorize the purchase of land for the purpose of selling it again. Bank of Alichigan v. Niles, Walk. (Mich.) 00 (1842); Pacific R. IL v. Seely, 45 Mlo. 212 (1870), where a railroad was hold to have no power to acquire land for spec- ulation; Land v. Coffman, 50 Mlo. 248 (1872), Rensselaer, etc. R. R. v. Davis, 43 N. Y. 187 (1870). Under such an ex- press power the corporation cannot purchase merely for the convenience of the corporation, nor for purposes foreign to its objects. State v. Mans- field, 23 N. J. L. 510 (1852); State v. Newark, 25 N. J. L 3815 (1855). But the purchase is presumed to be for purposes mentioned in the charter. Chautauque County Bank v. Risley, 19 N. Y. 300 (1850); Ex parte Pe.u Iron Co., 7 Cow. 540 (1827); Moss v. Rossie Lead Min. Co., 5 Hill, 137 (1843); Alward v. Holmes, 10 Abb. N. Cas. 90 (1880), where a foreign bank had purchased. A rail- road, instead of condemning a right of waly, may purchase the fee. Nicoll v. New York, etc. R IL, 12 N. Y. 121 (1854). 1 This arose from the fact that the judges of the supreme court, appointed to examine and report to the legisla- ture such of the English statutes as were in force in that state, reported that the statutes of mortmain were " so far in force that all conveyances . . . miade to a body corporate, or for the u.ae of a body corporate, are void, un-
			less sanctioned by charter or act of assembly." The report may be found in 13 Blnney (Pa.), 505, 020 (1808). See also Metlodlist Church v. Remington, 1 Watts (Pa.), 218 (1832); Miller v. Porter, 53 Pa. St. 202 (1800). The statute of April 0, 1833, made all purchases of land by or for corporations, without tihe license of tle commonwealth, subject to forfeiture. Under this act it hias been held that a foreign corporation may purchase and hold real estate in Pennsylvania, subject to being divested by tle direct action of the state. Run- yan v. Coster, 14 Pet. 122 (1840). To same effect, Leazure v. Hillegas, 7 Serg. &#x0026; IR (Pa.) 813 (1821). A similar statute, passed April 20, 1855, was con- strued to the same effect in Hickory Farm Oil Co. v. Buffalo, etc. IL R., 32 Fed. Rep. 22 (1887), after having been declared a mortmain act in American Slate Co. v. Phillipsburg, etc. Bank, 8 W. N. Cas. 430 (1880). A person sued in Pennsylvania on a debt to a foreign corporation cannot set up that the cor- poration is illegally holding land in the state. Grant t. Henry Clay Coal Co., 80 Pa. St. 208 (1870). Where a foreign corporation cannot directly own land in a state, it cannot own land indi- rectly by owning a majority of the stock of a domestic corporation which owns tle land. The state may escheat the land. Commonwealth v. New York, etc. R. R., 114 Pa. St. 840 (1880). But under the statutes of Pennsylvania it is legal for a railroad company to own all the stock of a mining company which owns land, and such land does not escheat. Commonwealth v. New York. etc. R. R.. 139 Pa. St. 457 (1891). See also 0695, infra, 1001

Even though a safe deposit com- pany is authorized to possess real es- tate necessary for the transaction of its business, and it erects a large office building fourteen stories high and rents nean- 11 of it, yet a tenant cannot avoid iayment of rent on the ground that it holds too much real estate.

This right of a corporation to act and contract in any state is duo to the spirit of comity between the states.0 It is constitutional, duly authorized by Its charter to take it. White v.

Where a Con- necticutcompany owning land in South Dakota sells it to a Minnesota corpora- tion organized to speculate in land, a subsequent deed by the former com- panyto an individual is not good. Only the state can question the power of the Minr.esota corporation to take title. The constitutional provision of Softh Dakota relative to land does not change this rule. Gilbert v. Hole, 2 S.

			Quoted and approved in Tootle v. Singer, 88 N. W. Rep. 440 (Towa, 1901) u As to the power of a foreign corpo- ration to do business in New York. the court, in Lancaster v. Amsterdam Imp. Co., 140 N. Y. 570, 591 (1894), said: "It seems to me to be very clear, upon ex- amination of our laws and by reference to such judicial opinions, that there never was a time in the history of the state when a foreign corporation was prevented from entering its bounda- ries to transact any lawful business which a non-resident natural person might have transacted here." In Peo- ple v. Fidelity, etc. Co, 153 IlL 25 (1804), it was held that, in the absence of an express prohibitory statute, a corpota- tion legally organized under the l-ws of another state to do a multiform in- surance business may do such business in Illinois, although such a ccrporation could not be organized under the laws of Illinois. 1071 Oil.

			Where a state statute provides that contracts made by foreign corporations shall not be enforced in tho courts of the state boforo compliance with certain requirements of the statute, the prohi- bition will not bo extended to suits brought in tilo federal courts, tilo contracts not being void.1 Even though a foreign corporation is engaged in a state in manufacturing products and sending them beyond the limits of the state, yet a state statute forbidding foreign corporations to transact business in the state until they have Illcd L copy of their charter with the secretary of state is legal, and the penalty that the contracts of such a corporation in tle state are void as regards the corporation, but are enforceable against til cor- poration, applies, and such statute may apply to a contract madl after tie statute was enacted but before it went into effect.2
			A requirement that a foreign corporation shall duly execute a power of attorney appointing an agent upon whom service of process may be made, or obtain a certificate from a state officer, is valid.

Rclmedy of the stoc7hholder 7terein.--Where, by reason of the negligence of the directors or other officers, the corporate funds, property, or rights have been lost, the injury is practically and ulti- mately an injury to the stockholders. But, in the eye of the law, the injury is to the corporation itself. The loss has depleted its treas- ury. Moreover, the negligent act was in reference to the affairs of the corporation. Accordingly, it is for the corporation to call the direct- ors to an account for their negligence. The action is not one which the stockholder is to bring. The negligence affects him, not directly, but indirectly. Hence, the law is well settled that a stockholder can- not bring the ordinary action at law for damages against the corpo- rate directors for their negligence in the management of the corpo- rate affairs.&#x0027; It is clear also that the stockholder cannot hold the cor- poration itself liable for the negligence herein of its directors. To allow such an action would be to make part of thie stockholders liable to other stockholders for the loss, when all are equally injured, equally innocent, and equally in position to complain.2 The usual and proper remedy is for the corporation itself to institute a suit at law against the guilty directors.3 If, however, the corporation is under the control of the guilty parties, or if it refuses to sue when requested by stockholders to do so, then the stockholder himself may bring a suit in equity in his own behalf, and in behalf of all other stock- holders who may wish to come in, making the corporation and the guilty parties the defendants, and compel them to make good to the corporation the corporate money or property lost by their neg- ligence.4 The money or property recovered in such an action be- 1 See § 734, infrat. remedy of the corporation may be in 20liphant v.

			§ 702. Instances o&#x0027;fneygligeinc of directors in the lerfoirmaul(no of their ldities.--It is difficult to lay down any rules as to what acts will constitute negligence on the part of corporate olllcers. Each case is to bo determined largely on its own facts. Thus, whore til directors kept no accounts, paid no calls, and collected no subscrip- tions, they were quite properly hold guilty of negligence an(t were made liable therefor.&#x0027; So also the directors of a national bank are liable whon they loan money to irresponsible persons, allow over- drafts, employ dishonest, unfaithful, and incompetent clerks, and neglect to take security from the cashier, president, and other oill- cers for good conduct and the performance of duties.3 Directors are not personally liable for error of judgment in declaring divi- (lends unless they were culpably or grossly ncgligent in the matter.4 Where the president of a corporation sells large quantities of coal to a firm which his sons control, and allows the debt to increase when le could easily have collected it, and ultimately the debt is lost, he is liable for negligence anti nust make good the loss.5 The president of a bank may be held personally liable to the bank for neg- ligence in permitting the cashier to loan bank funds on inadequate security and concealing the facts from the board of directors.6 The holders dissent. People v. Anglo-Amer- ican, etc. Assoc., 00 N. Y. App. Div. 0 (1901). In the case of Woerz v. Schu- macher, 37 N. Y. App. Div. 374 (1899), a suit by a receiver of an insolvent bank against the directors was compromised by the directors paying thirty-five per cent. of the liabilities of the bank and taking all the assets and agreeing to pay to the receiver anything realized by them over and above such thirty- five per cent.

			business usages of the community enter into the question of whether a director waBs negligent in making loans. The directors may com- mit tile business to the officers, but must give reasonable super- vision and not be guilty of gross inattention. Thus, the loan of one-third of the capital stock to one person is not necessarily negli- gent.&#x0027; Where for three years the directors turn tle management cver to tlh cashlir, of no responsibility, and know of illegal loans and neglect to record mortgages, they are liable for losses incurred thereby.2 Directors in a national bank are not liable for the mis- conduct of tlh cashier in making excessive loans to a particular corporation where such directors have no reason to suspect such loans; but an examining committee of directors whose duty it is to examine the securities are liable, where such committee knew of such loan.&#x0027; Where the president of a bank cancels a debt of the bank against one of his relatives in exchange for securities which ulti- mately become worthless, he is liable for the loss.&#x0027; It is negligence for directors to build a hotel before they have provided funds therefor and before they have tie title to the land.&#x0027; Directors of a bank are not liable in an action for dleceit brought by a purchaser of stock, although they signed the cashier&#x0027;s annual statement which was false, there being proof that they believed it to be true.u A director is not liable for a deposit made in a bank after it was in- solvent, where there was no fraud on his part inducing the deposit.&#x0027; But a director in a bank is personally liable to persons who deposit their money in the bank after lie knows that it is hopelessly in- solvent, where he fails to initiate measures to close the business of the bank. It is his duty to call a meeting of the directors, or re- bank is personally liable to the bank if he permits the cashier to borrow a large sum on inadequate security. He is bound to exercise that degree of care that a careful man would exercise in his own affairs of like importance. A director, however. who takes no part in the transaction is not liable for the neg- ligenceof other directors. Commercial Bank v. Chatfield, 121 Mich. 641 (1899). ! Wheeler v.

The act itself may be impeached and set aside, and property transferred there- under may be recovered back; but if the directors have made an honest mistake, and it was a mistake which a man of usual intelli- gence might make, they are not personally liable therefor. The law does not require them to be learned in the law.&#x0027; Bank direct- ors who meet but once or twice during the year, and do not exam- ine the books, and have no knowledge of affitrs, are liable for losses resulting from long-continued overdrafts by insolvent par- ties.0 A bank has no power to accept notes in payment of a sub- scription to its stock, and the directors are personally liable for so doing, unless the notes were good or the directors had reasonable cause to believe they were good.7 Managers of a building-loan corporation are liable for loans made to a firm in excess of the amount allowed by a by-law; but are not liable for a mistaken estimate of value of the security taken, nor for a defect in the ac- knowledgment of the security--a mortgage.8 A director has been held not liable for negligence in failing to sue for a debt due to the corporation.9 Directors are not liable for money lost by an over- 1 Cassidy v.

Where the board of directors allow an illegal preference to one director they are personally liable to ot her creditors to the extent of such preference, and, even though one of them resigns, the liability continues for the benefit of past as well as future creditors. Nix v. Miller, 20 Colo. 203 (1899R Where a lease of a street rail- way ins been made, in accordance with the vote of the stockholders and direct- ors, a stockholder cannot hold the di- rectors personally liable for not inform- ing the stockholders of an offer to purchase the property, it not being shown that the offer was from a.re- sponsible party or that it would have made any difference in the stockholders&#x0027; action. Strunk.v. Owen, 199 Pa. St. 78 (1001 . 3The leading case on the liability of directors for negligence is Charitable Corp. t.

Pieratt v. Young, 49 S. W. Rep. 004 (Ky. 1890).

The fact that a by-law of a bank requir- ing the directors to extmine the bank every three months has been long dis- regarded does not raise a presumption of repeal and does not release the di- rectors from liability for negligence leading to a defalcation. Campbell v. Watson, 50 Atl. Rep. 120 (N. J. 1001). For the mere failure of bank directors to exercise ordinary diligence in the management of the bank they cannot be held liable by general creditors. Union Nat. Bank, etc. v. Hill, 148 MIo. 880 (1800).

Warren v. Robison, 19 Utah, 280 (1899. The case of Re Cardiff Sav. Bank, [1892] 2 Ch. 100, is an example of one mode of doing busi- ness. The Marquis of Bute was made president of a savings bank at the age of six months. He continued to be president from 1848 until 1880. Dur- ing this time he attended one meeting in 1809. His name, however, always appeared in the pass-books, annual re- ports, and circulars. He paid no atten- tion whatsoever to the bank. It trans-
			pired in 1880 that the deceased actuary of the bank hbad defrauded it of a great deal of money. The court held that the marquis was not liable. The duty of an auditor is to examine the books, ascertain their correctness. and prepare a balance sheet showing the company&#x0027;s financial position at the time lie is apn pointed, but ie is bound to use only a reasonable amount of care and skill, varying according to the case.

			them; and not to shut their eyes to obvious objections to the busi- ness transactions and general condition of the corporation, or to the character and well-known reputation of the employees. MBore- over, when a director has knowledge that an unauthorized act is being done, he cannot escape liability, however innocent he may be, unless he prevonts the act by his protest, or files a bill in equity to remedy the wrong.&#x0027; Oibb, L. I 5 II. L. 480 (1872). Where loans without securities are improperly made, and the guilty directors are liable therefor, a director who did not partio- ipate is nevertheless liable, if ho does not take steps to remedy the matter as soon as he learns of it. Jackson v. Munster Bank, 15 L. R. Ir. 850 (1885). After a director sends in a letter of resignation ho is not liable for the wrongful acts of the directors, even though no attention is paid to his letter. Perry&#x0027;s Case, 84 L. T. Rep. 710 (1870). In the case of MIovius t. Lee, 80 Fed. Rep. 208, 807 (1887), the court held, review- ing the cases, that "there is no case which has been cited or observed in which it has been decided that a director of a corporation was liable to make good a loss occasioned by the fraud or misconduct of a co-director, in which he had no part, and which was perpetrated without his connivance or knowledge. . . . It is nowhere ad- judged that all must always act, or that they must not trust one another to act. or that they are liable for the mere omission to watci and restrain the others, without wrong intention on their own part, or actual knowledge of the wrong on the part of the others" Directors are required to use such care and diligence as a prudent man exer- cises in his own affairs If he utterly neglects his duties lie is liable. Horn, etc. Co. v. Ryan, 42 Minn. 198 (1889). Misfeasance is such non-feasance as is
			106
			negligence amounting to a breach of trust. Liability for negligence cannot be imputed to directors unless It is gross negligence resulting in loss. To constitute gross negligence there must be, first, a plain duty to do or abstain from a particular thing; secondly, such abstention or such action as the court would be justified in holding to be mis- chievous or reckless. When a duty in. cumbent on the directors has not been performed, the burden of proving gross negligence is on those who allege that conclusion; but where the facts estab- lish gross negligence, but at the same time show that it is possible or likely that a satisfactory explanation ought to be forthcoming. the burden of proof is shifted.

			There is an infinite variety of contracts which tile corporation may enter into, and the great mass of law on this subject is con- stantly beingincreased by now decisions. A corporation may onter into any contract which is within its express or implied powers. And oven a contract which is not within the express or implied powers of the corporation is sometimes enforced against it or in its behalf wlon one party to the contract has already performed, or when the parties cannot be restored to their original positions.1

			1 See oh. XL, supra. 2 Quoted and approved in Dickerman v. Northern T. Co., 176 U. S. 181, 203 (100). An interesting desoription of the "promoter" is given by Judge Lur- ton, in MoMullen v. Ritchie, 64 Fed. Rep. 253, 260 (1894). as follows: "He was a man of great abiijty, enormous energy. and a towering ambition for great enterprises As a promoter or &#x0027;boomer&#x0027; he seems to be unrivaled; a man of large general information and robust constitution, extraordinarily sanguine, desperately pugnacious, gen- erous as a prince, and possessing no de- gree of caution whatever. His ambi- tion was to make millions" Pro- moters are the persons who under- take to form and set going a company with reference to a given project."

A trust company receiving subscriptions to the stock of a corpora- tion and issuing receipts therefor, to the effect that upon payment the party should receive from the trust company a certificate for the stock in the pro- posed corporation, may be liable for misstatements in the prospectus which had been issued by the promoters.

			There has been groat difficulty in deternining who is to be considered a promoter and who is not. As regards the liability to strangers, however, it seems that every one is liable heroin as a promoter who induces such stranger to act in expectation of pay- ment from the prospective corporation. Having induced the party to act, the promoter must see that he is paid.
			In America tile question of tile liability of promoters to persons who have performed services or entered into contracts relative to a prospective corporation has rarely arisen. But in England this question has frequently been passed upon. In general the promoter of a prospective corporation is liable for services rendered by oth- ers who are employed as clerks, engineers, or in a similar capacity in the work of promoting the enterprise.t promoter seems temporarily to have Ga. 010 (1800).

Where nostock is subscribed for, but an organization meeting is held and officers elected and debts incurred, the officers are liable for such debts. Whetstone v. Crane, etc. Co., 1 Kan. App. 820 (1895), the ground of the decision being that such officers are merely promoters. In Nova Scotia, where a subscribet sues a pro. moter for damages for fraud in obtain. ing for himself stock and bonds ille- gally, the suit must be by the corpora- tion, or by the stockholder if the cor- poration refuses to sue.

			[C.I, XLIII. Tlhe subject of the liability of persons who soil a business to a cor- poration for stocks, bonds, or cash is considered olsowhiere.
			Wheorc a promiotor has boon hold liable to strangers ho may havo contribution from his follow-promoters.2 Whore tho secretary was the original promotor and persuaded tile others to go in, ho cannot recover from theom for his services.3 They aro not liable to each other for services.4 A person may colleoot on a surveying contract from co-promoters, though he was also a promoter." But not for services as secretary.°
			Another lilllcult question connected with this subject is the lia- bility of one promoter to another for breach of tilo contract of promotion. Tile general rule is that whoro tile contract is dellnito and tile obligations are clear, an action at law vill lio by one promoter against another for a breach thereof.?

They may recover damages, not as members of the company, but " which they suffered, if any, by rea- son of the defendants preventing them from successfully establishing and fit- ting out a business to be conducted by them as a" company.

Where a per- soi owning certain property agrees witl others that a corporation shall be formed and he shall receive pay for the property In cash and stook on a certain basis, and he turns over his property to the others for that purpose and they fail to form the corporation, he may hold them liable In damages. Mosier v. Parry, 00 Ohio St. 88 (1899). Where several owners of riparian rights and lands agree to organize a company and transfer their property to it for stock, and a few of them make such transfer and the others refuse to do so, the former may have the transfers made by them canceled.

A contract botweoo the owner of prop)orty and a Ipromlotor by whichl thi formeor grees to usll his property to a corporation to be forumed by tho latter, with a specified capital stock, cannot, a year after the transaction hns been carried out, be made the basis of a suit in equity to compel tho pro. moter to cancel excessive stock which was -isuod to tlh promoter, there being no allegation that the promoter still had tih stock. Tihe remedy of the vendor is at law. Even though sevoral vendors to the corporation liad a sini. lar claim, yet one of tllhen cannot file such a bill in equity in behalf of him. self and others. Brelnm v. Sperry, 90 Md. 378 (1001). An agreement between promoters that one of themi should buy certain real estate and turn it over to tie Corporation must be in writing to satisfy the statute of frauds. IcLen- nan r. Boutell, 117 Mici. 544 (1898). An agreement of several parties to sell their property to a corporation in ex- change for stock of the latter, the amount of stock going to each to be determined by arbitrators, will not be specifically enforced where the arbi- trators have fixed the value in an ille- gal way. Any party may withdraw from such a contract prior to the time when it has been signed by all Con- solidated, etc. Co. v. Nash, 100 Wis. 490 (1901) Where a promoter contracts with the owners of patent rights to form a corporation and issue a certain part of its stock for the patents, and to sell the remainder at a certain price, the money to be divided in a certain way, and they refuse to proceed, and he sues for damages, he must prove complete performance on his part, or that lie was ready and able to perform and did not do so on account of the
			acts of tho other parties. If ho alleges full performaince ho must provo it, and u charter with $500 capital, with the right to increaso to $300,000, may not be such prorl&#x0027;mance, Stern v. McKeeo 70 N. Y. App. Div. 142 (1002). The state- ment of certain parties to a promoter that in case they organized a company proposed by him le would be made general agent, does not sustain a suit by him on a quanltlmn mcrrits. Fla- lherty v. Murray, 00 N. Y. App. Dlv. 03 (1001) A contract between promoters, by wliicl one of them is to be employed by a proposed insurance company on a salary and a percentage of premiums, is too indefinite to be enforced, oven though some of the pronoters pro- ceeded to form the company. It seems also that sucl a contract iscontriry to public policy. Flalerly v. Cary, 02 N. Y. App. Div. 110 (1001). Where a per- son has turned i securities under a plan of consolidation, which states the aggregate capacity of properties wlhich it is proposed to acquire, or so many of them as the organizers may deem best, the party cannot withdraw, where the plan las been carried out, even though less than half of the properties have been actually acquired. And even though tile preliminary contract pro- vided for the acquisition of a certain company, yet, if the consolidated com- pany acquires practically all the stock and bonds of that company, the party turning in securities cannot withdraw, and especially cannot reclaim the se- curities as against a transferee in good faith who had no notice of personal representations.

Banty v. Johsonl, 00 Ark. 520 (1809). Wlhero promoters agree to construct a railroad and to give a part of the stock to par- ties who furnish valuable privileges, right of way, grants, etc., but instead of doing so sell out the affair to a coin- peting railroad company, which buys with notice and does notgo on with the enterprise, the parties who are injured may sue the purchasing railroad com- pany for an accounting, etc. The pro- moters are not necessary parties de. fendant. Hamilton t. Savannah, etc. Ry., 49 Fed. Rep. 412 (182). A pro. moter who has brought about the sale of a large plant to new parties, who have agreed to organize a new corpora- tion and give the promoter a certain amount of stock therein, cannot, upon the ground that he is being defrauded of his commissions, enjoin the parties from closing the transaction irrespect- ive of the promoter, nor can he get specific performance of the contract to incorporate a company and deliver the stock. There is no fiduciary relation between the parties. The value f the stock can be estimated in ds jages. There was no allegation of defendant&#x0027;s insolvency. The promoter has ample remedy at law for damages. Avery v. Ryan, 74 Wis. 591 (1889). Specific per- formance of a contract to form a cor- poration will not be granted. Avery v. Ryan, 74 Wis. 591 (1889). As to the remedy at law, see Crow v. Green, 111 Pa. St. 037 (18860; Hudson v. Spaulding,

For tie meas- ure of damages for the breach of a con- tract of defendants to organize a com- palny and pay to plaintiff for his patents certain stock and cash, see Kirsch- mann v. Lednrd, 01 Barb. 578 (1872) As to the measure of damages in a suit by a vendor of property to the cor- poration for damages against it and its promoters for breach of the contract to employ him as manager, see Mlarston v. Singapore Rattan Co., 108 Mass. 200 (1895). Although two partners desire to incorporate. and each to have the same interest, and a third party to have a smaller interest, thereby holding the balance of power, and such arrange- ment is carried out, and the third party is really adummy of oneof t he partners, and thereby gives the control of the corporation to that partner, yet the other partner has no legal cause of complaint, notwithstanding the gen- eral understanding as to the division of control.

			Niles v. Graham, 02 N. E. Rep. 980 (Mass 192). Where a vendor contracts with a-person to transfer his patents to a corporation for stock and cash, and such person agrees to furnish the money to carry on the business, but fails to do so. in a suit by the vendor, if lie asks for rescission and also for damages, he should separately state these two causes of action.

			Where a promoter agrees to pay a certain compensation to a person for services to bo performed by the latter in connection with a reorganization, the promoter must pay such compensation, even though lie changes his reorganization agreemnent and carries out the reorganization with other parties than those originally contenmplated.? But an agreement of various stooliholdors in sev- eral street railway companies to form a now corporation and trans- ser their interest thereto and divide the now stock in a certain pro- portion does not constitute such a partnership as to entitle one to sue the others for an accounting of profits where the others had formed such a corporation with other parties, leaving out the first- named party.2 thereof or the organization of a com- pany, and the broker introduces n party with whom the promoter subsequently organizes the company, it may be a question for the jury as to whether such organization was substantially within the meaning of the contract. West v. Demme, 128 lich. 11 (1001). Where two promoters agree to purchase certain property and organize a corpo- ration to take it over, and one of them purchases it himself and organizes the company and tak:s all the stock, the other promoter &#x0027;raty hold both him and the corporation liable for that portion of the stock which he was to have, it being shown that the corteration knew of the contract. Sun, et Co. t Frost, 64 Pac. Rep. 433 (Ariz. 1901). 1 Babbitt r. Gibbs, 150 N. Y. 281 (1800). 2Schantz t: Oakman, 168 N. Y. 148 (1900). A contract between a stock- holder and a third person by which the third person is to be made adirector,and agrees to devote his time and attention to the business, and develop the prop- erty, and procure the construction of a railroad, and cause various lots of land owned by the corporation to be sold, will not sustain an action at law for damages by the stockholder for breach of the contract. An action in such a case may be maintained only by the corporation or by the stockholder in its behalf. So farasthe contract intended to control the action of the board of di. rectors, it was illegal Kountze v. Flan-
			nagan, 10 N.Y. Supp. 83(1802). Where a promoter buys property for the cor- poration before it is formed, and the seller supposes he is selling to a corpo- ration, but the latter is never formed, the seller may recover back the prop- erty, even from one who bought the property from the promoter in good faith. Wyckoff v. Vicary, 75 Hun, 400 (1804). In Angle v. Chicago, etc. Ry., 151 U. S. 1 (1804), a contractor was har- assed and prevented frim completing his contract by the comlpany which had passed under the control of another company that &#x0027;as seeking to get a land grant that had teen given conditionally to the fornme.rolnnpany. The contractor was ruined, the road not completed, and the second company got the land grant by a subsequent legislative act. The contractor got judgment against the first company, and then filed a bill against the second company to reach the land, charging conspiracy, bribery, and fraud. The court, overruling the decision below, held that a demurrer to the bill was not good. Where the ven- dor of a majority of the stock of a cor- poration agrees that the company owes no debts except certain specific ones, the vendee mayprecover back any ex- cess of debts over those specified. Where the debts of one class were not to exceed a certain sum, but did exceed that sum, the vendee may recover the difference, even though the debts of another class were less than a sum speci- 1705

			Where a party agrees with a promoter and constructor of water- works that he, the former, will take a certain amount of water from the corporation for ten years, and he fails to (do so, the former may hold him liable. It is immaterial that no formal contract was made with the company. The contractor, owning practically all the stock of the company, may sue and collect for himself the price of tile water less the cost.&#x0027; A promise and contract of promoters to subscribers to certain bonds may give the latter an equitable lien on the bonds enforceable in equity.2
			On the other hand, even though an inventor is persuaded to turn in his inventions to a corporation for stock on an oral assurance that plenty of money would be forthcoming to take the stock of the company and make the business successful, and oven though the parties making suhe representations do not advance the money, but allow the company to become insolvent, and buy in the assets, in- eluding the patents, yet the inventor cannot maintain an action for fraud in failing to furnish money according to promise.3 A pro- moter who has taken a contract to purchase a property at a certain price, based upon reports and representations that the business had not decreased since the reports, may, upon discovering that the business has largely decreased, refuse to carry out the contract, and fled in the contract of sale. Chicago, etc. Ry. v. Hoyt, 89 Wis. 314 (1895). A promoter who does not complete the transaction or consummate an enforce- able contract cannot recover commis- sions. Hammond v. Crawford, 00 Fed. Rep. 425 (1895). Where one of the promot- ers agrees with others that he will pur- chase property and turn it in to the com. pany, the price to apply on his subscrip- tion for stock, and he does purchase, and the company takes possession of the property and builds thereon, he will be compelled to transfer title to the company. Nester v. Gross, 00 ifinn. 871 (1800). Sometimes, where the cor- poration cannot enforce the contract, the promoters may. Carmody v. Pow- ers, 60 Mich. 20 (1886). Where one pro- moter sues another for failure to form the corporation, and obtains a verdict for the par value of the stock which plaintiff was to receive, there being no proof as to what the value would have been if issued, nor whether the com- pany would be successful, the verdict
			will be set aside as excessive, Pitt v. Kellogg, 11 N. Y. Supp. 520 (1800). A contract between promoters by which one agrees to assist in the building of a road is too definite to sustain an action for breach thereof. Porter v. Blair, 83 Fed. Rep. 104(1897). Wherecompeting applicants for a street-railway franchise agree to act together, whereby one isto withdraw and the other is to obtain the grant, and the benefits are to bede- vided equally, which is done with the full knowledge of the municipal au- thorities, and then the one who secured the grant refuses to divide with the other, the remedy of the latter is at law, and not in&#x0027; equity, even if the agree- ment should be held to be valid. Hyer v. Richmond Traction Co., 108 U. S. 471 (1897), modifying 80 Fed. Rep. 839. 1 Drummond v. Crane, 159 Mass. 577 (1893). 2 Badgerow v. Manhattan Trust Co., 04 Fed. Rep. 931 (1894). 3 Smith v.

The question sometimes arises whether a subscriber for stock in a projected corporation is liable to its creditors in ease the enterprise is abandoned before incorporation; and also whether the promoters of the abortive corporation are liable to the subscribers for deposits made by the latter.

Brighaml, 127Mass. 24 (1870), the court saying also: "Those who nated as agents for the inohoato corpo. ration acted without a principal behind tlhom, because tliero was no body cor. porate capable of appointing agents, and so became principals in the trans. action." See also Duke v. Andrews, 3 Exch. 200 (1848); Hutton v. Thomnpson, 3 H. L. Cas. 101 (1857); Duke v. Diver, 1 Exoh. 80 (1847), where the stockholder had promised to pay on a certain day, and was held to his promise. To same effect, Duke v. Sorbes, 1 Exol. 850 (1847); Aldham v. Brown, 7 El. &#x0026; Bl. 104 (1857); 2 El. &#x0026; El. 808, on appeal; Woolmer v. Toby, 10 Q. B. 001 (1847). However, in the case of Lake v. Duke of Argyle, 0 Q. B. 477 (1844), the court held that attendance at a meeting, an- nouncement of intention of being presi. dent and of taking stock, and concur- rence in measures for incorporation, may be strong evidence that de- fendant "held himself out as a pay- master to all who executed the orders." The question, then, is for the jury. Where a proposed corporation, never incorporated, contracts to purchase cer- tain property of a subscriber, he can- not bring suit at Zaw against other sub- scribers for damage caused by non-ful- fillment of contract. Crow v. Green, 111 Pa. St. 037 (188). Subscribers are not liable. Bourne v. Freeth, 9 B. &#x0026; C. 032(1829). Unless theyallow themselves to be held out as partners in the enter- prise.

In Oakes v. Cattaraugus Water Co., 148 N. Y. 480 (1894), prior to incorporation a written agreement was made in the name of the company with a party who agreed to secure the right of way, hydrant rental, and to place invest- ments, etc., and was to receive pay from the corporation. Ho was also to abandon a rival water-works scheme and to aid generally. The president and general manager of the corporation after the incorporation acknowledged the debt and contract, and promised payment. The court held that the fact that the president called upon the party for performance constituted ratification. The whole question was for the jury. Although the promoters have no authority to bind the company by their agreements as to the construc- tion contract, yet where the company receives a benefit from such agreement, and in its records and minutes recog- nizes it. the company will be liable in damages for letting the contract to others.

Tho law is clear tlat stockholders in meeting assembled have the power to make the by-laws of the corporation.2 The&#x0027; stockholders also have the power to accept resignations of directors ant fill vacancies in the board.3
			§ T09. Stockholders cannot carry on the business or enter into con- tracts fJr the corporatiol - These are the fiunctions of the direct- ors - One person owning all the stock -" Du nmmy" corporations.- The stockholders cannot enter into contracts with third persons. Contracts between the corporation and third persons must be entered into by the directors and not by the stockholders. The corporation, in such matters, is represented by the former and not by the latter. Such is one of the main objects of corporate existence. To the di- rectors are given the management and formation of corporate con- tracts..

"When a cha-ter invests a board with the power to manage the concerns of a corporation the power is exclusive in its character. The corpora- tors have no right to interfere with it, and courts will not, even on a petition

The directors were their representatives and alone authorized to act." McCul- lough tv Molss, 5 Denio, 507, 575 (1840). The stockholders do not make the con- tracts. Solomon Co. v.

			Tho law seems to be clear that all corporate contracts are to be made by the directors. This includes the original contracts as well as modifications of them. If a contract is within the express or implied powers of the corporation, then the directors need not con- sult the stockholders nor follow their wishes, even though the lat- ter constitute a majority or a minority, and though these stock- holders object in mcoting assembled or individually in the courts. Thus, a lease of the corporate property is authorized, not by the stockholders, but by the directors.&#x0027; Even though a statute author- izing one railroad corporation to guarantee the bonds of another corporation provides that such guaranty shall be made only upon a petition of a majority in interest of the stockholders of the former, yet if the guaranty is actually executed by order of the board of directors without any such petition, a bona fide purchaser of tlle bonds may enforce such guaranty, although a purchaser with no- tice cannot enforce it.&#x0027; Ilowever, if the contract is beyond the express and implied powers of the corporation, then any stock- holder may have the contract enjoined or set aside. lie can do so even though a majority of the stockholders approve the act and ratify it in meeting assembled. IIe may resort to the courts.3

The supreme courtof the United States says: "Ono who takes from a railroad or business corpora- tion, in good faith, and without actual notice of any inherent defect, a negotiable obligation issued by order of the board of directors, signed by the president and secretary in the namo and under the seal of the corporation, and disclosing upon its face no want of authority, has the right to assume its validity, if the corporation could, by any action of its offcers or stockholders, or of both, have authorized the execution and issue of the obligation."3 The second exception is that, where a corporation is merely a "dummy," the court has power to ignore its corporate existence and to hold that the acts of the stockholder are the acts of the corporation itself.4
			Thus, where a railroad company causes a telegraph company to be incorporated, and subscribes to all its stock and appoints all not been authorized by the board of directors or a meeting of the stockhold- ers, it being shown, however, that the officers made the contract and that it was approved by a majority of the stockholders, and was reported at the next meeting of the stockholders and was not objected to, and has been carried into effect and payments made and operation carried on in accordance therewith.

			Where tlh corporation does business by organizing branch cor- porations, and tih stockholders in the latter are disregarded, and the main corporation pays up the stock and manages it without re- gard to its corporate character, the property of the branch corpora- tion is subject to the debts of tlhe parent company.2
			Sometimes a "dummy" corporation is used to hold land, the stockholders being aliens or foreign corporations.3
			§ 7U1. &#x0027;lie e.7plsion of stocl;holdter.s.-The law forbids the di- rectors or stockholders of a corporation having a capital stock from depriving him of his rights as a stockholder. Ho certainly cannot be deprived of his right to divi(ends equally with other stockholders.4 lie cannot he deprived of his right to vote." And it is clear that his various rights as a stockholder cannot be taken from him by any or all of the other stockholders. In this respect a corporation having a capital stock is clearly different from a cor- poration formed for religious, social, charitable, and similar pur- poses. The former is for purposes of gain, and the property which is represented by stock cannot be taken from a stockholder by ex- pelling him from the corporation.6 It is doubtful whether a stock corporation can impose a fine upon the stockholder for a violation of its by-laws.7
			§ 711. Stockholders cannot ohange t1he directors except at elec- tions.- The term of office of directors is usually fixed by the char- ter of the corporation or the statutes applying to it. Such being the case, a director having been elected is entitled to hold his position until the expiration of his term of oflice. lie cannot be turned out either by the stockholders,8 or the directors, or by a l Interstate Tel.

			§ 712. Directors - Their power as a board and as individuals to contractol br the corporation- Ratification by the directors.--All contracts of a corporation are to be made by or under the direction of its board of directors. The board of directors make corporate contracts by a regular vote of tlhe board; or by authorizing an agent to make them; or by allowing an agent to assume and ex- orcise that power; or by accepting a contract or its benefits after it has been made by an unauthorized agent. And in all cases the board of directors and not the stockholders, nor the president, sec- retary, treasurer, or other agent, is the original and supreme power in corporations to make corporate contracts. The stockholders, indeed, have very few functions.3 The board of directors have the witlest of powers. All of the various acts and contracts which a cor- poration may enter into4 are entered into by and through the board of directors. The board of directors make or authorize the making of the notes, bills, mortgages, sales, deeds, liens, and contracts gen- erally of the corporation. They appoint the agents, direct the busi- ness, and govern the policy and plans of the corporation. The di- rectors elect the officers, and in this connection it may be added that "at common law there is no limit to the number of offices which may be held simultaneously by the same person, provided that neither of them is incompatible with any other."" They institute, prosecute, compromise, or appeal suits at law and in equity which the corporation brings or has brought against it.6

			of giving notice of directors&#x0027; meetings. Mtany cases apply to direct- ors&#x0027; meetings tile Bm111e rules tlhat apply to stockholders&#x0027; meetings. Other cases hold that less formality and strictness are required in calling a directors&#x0027; Ileeting. The decisions aro quite uniform, how- ever, in holding that as to all special meetings of the board of di- rectors notice must be given.&#x0027; I A mortgago authorized lit a special meeting of directors, no notice of which had been given to two directors who were not present, is not enforceable, the minutes not having beeo approved at, any subsequent meeting. Curtin v. Salmon, etc. Ca., 1U0 Cal. 345 (1900). A mortgage authorized at a Imeeting of the board of directors of which no notice was given and soime of the di- rectors were absent is not valid, and the declarations of a joint mortgagor that the corporation had authorized the mortgage are inadmissible. cRlley v. Campbell, 184 Cal. 175 (1901). A chattel mortgage authorized at a di. rectors&#x0027; meeting at which only half the directors were present, and notice of which had not been given to directors who were not present, is illegal. Brough- ton v. Jones, 120 lich. 402 (1899). A director who is not a stockholder can- not complain that a meeting of the di- rectors was held without notice to him. Anderson, etc. Co., v. Pungs, 127 Mich. 543 (1901). Notice to all the trustees of a religious corporation is necessary. Thompson v. West, 82 N. W. Rep. 13 (Neb. 1900). "That all the directors are entitled to notice, either express or implied, of any meeting at which any business is transacted, in order that the business may be binding upon all the persons concerned, admits of no .question., . . If the meetings held are regular meetings,- that is, such as are provided for by charter or the by-laws, fixing time and place,-then notice thereof is implied. Of all other meet. ings, especially those at which any business not pertaining to the ordinary affairs of the corporation is transacted, express notice must be given of the time and place and the object or
			purpose of tie mooting." Hence an assignment of bank accounts by a cor- poration to its president, lis collateral security, is not valid wheoro no notice was given to all the directors of tho meeting authorizing the asslgnment. Whitlhead v. Hamilton Rubbor Co., 52 N J. Eq. 78 0!893). A person who is ekl&#x0027;ted a directoi but does not accept need not be notified of a directors&#x0027; meeting. Whittaker v. Amnwoll Nat. Bank, 52 N. J. Eq. 400 (1804). A meet- ing of a majority of the directors at an unusual time and place is not valid where the minority had no notice. First Nat. Bank v. Asleville, etc. Co., 110 N. C. 827 (1895). A special meeting of directors is void if no notice is given to absent directors. The fact that a director owns or controls a majority of the stock does not validate such a meet- ing even though lie favored their action. Hill v. Rich Hill, etc. Co., 119 Mo. 9 (1893). Where the directors of a bank are ac- customed to hold directors&#x0027; meetings at the bank whenever a quorum is present, this custom will be upheld, and a meeting is legal although no notice thereof is given, there being no by-law or statute on the subject. American Nat. Bank v. First Nat. Bank, 82 Fed. Rep. 901 (1807). Directors are required to take notice of an annual meeting, and no notice need be given of an adjournment thereof. Western Imp. Co. v. Des Moines Nat. Bank, 103 Iowa, 455 (1a97). Even though no notice is given to a director of a meeting of the board, yet where the matter passed upon by the board is one which lie would be disqualified from voting upon, the meeting is legal.

			Tih lawV is inclined to tolerate more froodom in tho notice and the calling and holding of lirectors&#x0027; mootings, innsmluch as tho autllorizoed at a meoting of tio board of direootors whlero a part of tho directors wero Iabsent and had no notice thereof, is not valid. Silon v. Sovier AssoC., 14 Arlk. 18 (1800). Notice of a directors&#x0027; meeting need not bo given to a director who resides abroad, nor to another di- rector who is traveling abroad. Tibe court, however, refused to lay down the broad rule that no notice in any case need be given to directors who are abroad. Ialifax, etc. Co. v. Frianoklyn, 02 L. T. Rep. 103 (180). Notice of a directors&#x0027; meoting caunlnot be waived in advance by a director where tle time and purpose of tile meeting have not yet boon determined upon. Re Portu- guese, etc. MIines, L. R. 42 Ch. D. 100 (1880). Where three of seven directors are nol-residents, one having sold his stock, one traveling. and one inacces- sible for immediate notice, the four remaining directors may hold a meet- ing and authorize an assignment of tile corporate property for the benefit of creditors: The assignment was held to be legal, the traveling director and the inaccessible director having subse- quently voted in a meeting for the selection of an assignee. National Bank of Commerce v. Shumway, 49 Kan..224 (1802). A mortgage authorized at a di- rectors&#x0027; meeting at which four were present and the other received no notice is illegal, the giving of notice being possible, and there being no neces- sity for immediate action. Bank of Little Rock v. McCarthy, 55 Ark. 473 (1892). An assignment for the benefit of creditors, made by order of a direct ors&#x0027; meeting at which three directors were present and the other two were not notified, is invalid, and no bar to a creditor&#x0027;s action to collect unpaid sub- scriptions. Doernbecher v. Columbia, etc. Co., 21 Oreg. 573 (189). Where a directors&#x0027; meeting, according to the by- laws, may be called by the president,
			17
			or if thore is no president by two di. rectors, the two lirectors cannot call it even if the president refuses to do so. The acts of a meeting of a board so called are illegal, a majority of tle di- rectors only being present. Smith v. Dorn, 00 Cal. 78 (1802). A director is entitled to notice of a meeting to elect a president. Undue blste and fiiiluro to give notice will sullico to sot the election aside. A subsequent mieeting of the board cannot ratify it. The election must be held over again. State v. Smith, 15 Oreg. 08 (1887); Singer v. Salt, etc. Co., 58 Pac. Rep. 1024 (1808). A notice of a school trustees&#x0027; peet- ing need not be given to trustees out of the state who could not have attended anyway. Porter v. Robinson, 30 Hun, 200 (1888). In Harding v. Vandewater, 40 Cal. 77 (1870), a note given for an as- sessment upon a subscription which was called at a special meeting of the board of trustees of a mining company, of which two of the trustees had no no- tice, was held to be void. In Farwell v. Houghton Copper, etc, 8 Fed. Rep. 00 (1881), it was held that one who had been a shareholder and purchased all the property of tile company at a meet- ing of the directors held without notice, at which he was present and knew that one director was absent, was bound to know that notice to such absent di- rector was necessary, and that he was not a bona fide purchaser without no- tice. Lane v. Brainerd, 80 Conn. 505 (1862), holding that tle corporate rec- ord of a meeting at which a quorum was present was presumptive proof that all the directors had been duly notified, whether living in the state or else- where. Where the deed of settlement provided for special meetings, the time and place of which were to be fixed by notices countersigned by the secretary, it *&#x0027;&#x0027;as held that a meeting of the requi- site number of directors without pre-

Louisville, etc. Ry. v. Louis- ville Trust Co., 174 U.

Davis, 8 Conn. 192 (1830), holding that a meeting of bank directors was legal for an ordi- nary transaction, although the notice did not specify its object,and that mort- gaging its real estate to secure a debt was proper at such meeting. Where, a few days before a new board was to go in, a notice of a directors&#x0027; meeting states that it is to hear the treasurer&#x0027;s report and transact other business that might come before the board, it is ille- gal for the board, at such meeting, to make a perpetual lease of all the corpo- rate property.

			the meeting, and the mode of giving or serving tle notice must bo reasonable. All this turns on the circumstances and facts in each case.&#x0027; Whore no special method of serving notice of directors&#x0027; meetings is prescribed, and the notice is served by mail, upon proof of mailing, the receipt of the notice is presumed, even us against a director&#x0027;s doubt as to his having received it.2 Notice to all the di- rectors is presumed.3 I A notice of a directors&#x0027; meeting sent out in the afternoon for the even- ing is sufficient, it delivered to a serv- ant at a director&#x0027;s residence, oven though suol director was absent from home, his absence not being known to the party calling the meeting until such notice was delivered. Re Argus Co., 188 N. Y. 557 (1893). Notice of a directors&#x0027; meeting, received on the morning of the day of the meeting. is insufficient although the meeting was to be at four o&#x0027;clock in the afternoon. The court said: " Pima facie this was not a reasonable time. The managers are all reported as business men, who cannot be presumed to be ready to drop their own affairs and attend off- hand on such a notice. One full day in advance of the time fixed is as little as the law could presume to be reason- able, and in many cases that would be too short." The court said, however, that a by-law or the practice of the board might vary this rule. Mercan- tile Library Hall Co. v. Pittsburgh Li. brary Assoc., 178 Pa. St. 30 (189S). A meeting of directors called in the morning for two o&#x0027;clock that day is in- valid where one director could not come until three o&#x0027;clock and another received the notice next morning. A quorum was present Re Homer, etc. Mines, L R 39 Ch. D. 546 (1888). Leav- ing notice of a directors&#x0027; meeting at a director&#x0027;s business place suffices, even though he is known to be ill. Corbett a. Woodward, 5 Sawyer, 403 (1870). Notice to a director is sufficient if given orally to the director&#x0027;s brother at the director&#x0027;s place of business, where a by- law allowed notice to be given by mail
			or in other ways. Williams v. German, etc. Ins Co., 08 I. 887 (1878). Notice to directors, sent by mall, is sufficient if sent in time so that the director, after receiving it, would have time to reach the place of meeting. Covert v. Rogers, 38 Mich. 808 (1878). A meeting of the directors may be valid although two of them, being absent from the state, did not receive the notice. Chase v. Tuttle, 55 Conn. 455 (1888). Tele- graphic notice to two directors out of the state, of a meeting to make an as- signment, is sufficient, though not re- ceived by them, a majority having met and ordered the assignment. Chase v. Tuttle, 55 Conn. 455 (1888). &#x0027; Ashley Wire Co. v. Illinois Steel Co., 104 111. 149 (1890). Where written no- tices of a special directors&#x0027; meeting, properly addressed, are sent by mail to them, it is presumed that such notices were received, though there is no by-law that notice may be given by mail. Stockton, etc. Works v. Houser, 109 Cal. 1 (1895). Notice by postal card of a di-. rectors&#x0027; meeting suffices where it is cus tomary and all received it. People v. Albany Med.

			Thoro has been a question whether directors could vote and act as a board without coming together. Many attempts havo beon madlo to sustain a vote of the directors, which they had separately and singly agreed to. The law, howover, is now clear that such separate nssent is void. Directors are elected to meet and confer, and to act after an opportunity for an interchange of ideas. They cannot vote or act in any other manner.&#x0027; lMany of tho cases to tho ing of the directors, sent to eacl of thorn a written n&#x0027;ttico by Iis ollice boy iaises a presumption that proper notice was given. Where the minlutes of a directors&#x0027; meeting are written out and signed by the secretary it is presumed that all directors had notice of the meeting. Balfour-Guthrie, otc. Co. tv Woodworth, 124 Cal. 109 (1800). It is presumed that directors had notice of a meoting. Mills v. Boyle, etc. Co., 132 Cal. 5 (1901) A corporation defending against its notu ou the ground that all the dlirectors were not notified of a meeting which authorized the same has the burden of proof of showing that such was the case. Barrell v. Lake, etc. Co., 122 Cal. 129 (1898). Notice to di- rectors is presumed. Singer v. Salt Lake City, etc. Co., 17 Utah, 143 (1898). 1 Tradesman Pub. Co. v.

Morse-Oliver, etc. Co., 94 Me. 406 (1000); Monroe, etc Co. v. Arnold, 108 Ga. 449 (1899). A deed of real estate executed by the directors of a corporation separately and at differ- ent times, but not formally authorized by them as a board, is not only ineffect- ual as a conveyance of real property, but equally so as a contract to convey. Baldwin v. Canfleld, 26 Minn. 43, 54 (1879). The verbal assent of directors to the execution of a mortgage is not good. Alta Silver Min. Co. v. Alta Placer Min. Co., 78 CaL 629 (1889). Where the directors own all the stock of a corporation, they may authorize its president to sell its assets, and the fact that the authority was not given at a regular directors&#x0027; meeting is im-

			Dilliculty has arisen in determining whether a person talcing a Ilortgallg from or executing a contract with a corporation is bound to ascertain whether a quorum of the directors were present at the directors&#x0027; meeting which autlorized the instrument, and whether a majority voted in favor thereof. There are many cases where mort- gages and contracts have been hold void by reason of defects in the calling, holding, or voting at the directors&#x0027; meeting.&#x0027;
			The rule sustained by the great weight of authority, howovor, is that where a corporate mortgage or contract is signed and sealed by the corporation and delivered to the proper person, who takes act is to be done by thoem, but a major- ity of that body imlst attend the as- sombly where such act is done." lex v.

Rep. 525 (1888), that where the board of directors was to consist of from three to seven, but the quorum to consist of two. and where by resignation the whole board is reduced to two, these two cannotact; norcan theyelectoneor
			more to ill the vacanlcies. The quorum can act only when tho board consists of the requisite number. This objec- tion, however, cannot be raised by one who tlakes part as director. Wlhero by clarter the board of directors is to be from live to seven, and three may act, three cannot act when there are but four directors. The act is not binding on the corporation. Kirk v. Bell, 10 Q. B. 290 (1851). See also Bottomley&#x0027;s Case, L R. 10 Ch. D. 081 (1880); Lindloy, Com- panics, p. 157.

A mortgage made by four directors when the statute re- quired five, there being one vacancy. is legal if the mortgage is ratified by the full board, and such ratification maybe by recognition of the mortgage in a second mortgage. Porter v. Lassen County, .etc. Co., 127 Cal. 201 (1899). Where there are two vacancies in a board of five, the act of two of the re- maining three directors is not legal, under the statutes of California. Brown v. Valley, etc. Co., 127 Cal. 030 (1900).

			[§ 718a. property of the company which has already boon assigned to an- othlr creditor cannot attack such assignment on the ground that, while the statute required three directors, only two directors ex- isted, the third one having resigned.&#x0027;
			A statute that upon an ollicer in a bank borrowing money of the bant without security, his office shall become vacant and ho shall ceaso to beconm a director, is self executing.&#x0027;
			Even though a director resigns for the sole purpose of avoiding a statutory liability and causes his son to be elected director in his placo and continues to be the agent and manager of the business, nevertheless he is not liable under the statute.3
			The question of whether the directors may delegate their au- thority to an executive committee has given rise to much coontro- rectors. Moreover, persons dealing with the corporation In ignorance of defects in the constitution of the board are not bound to tako notice of it and may enforce their claims. Re Bank of Syria, [19001 2 Ch. 272: af&#x0027;d, [1001] 1 Ch. 115. Where there are vacancies in the board of directors the remaining di- rectors have no pow:r to act unless the charter or by-laws of the company au- thorize them to act under such cir- cumstances; but as to all matters in the ordinary course of business of the company, persons dealing with the cor- poration in good faith are protected, even though there are vacancies in the board of directors Lindley on C.m- panies (5th ed.), p 157. A committee of arbitration may act by a majority vote unless the agreement provides otherwise. The resignation of one mem- ber just before the award is made does not invalidate the award. Republic of Colombia v. Cauca Co., 100 Fed. Rep. 337 (1901). 1 Castle v. Lewis, 78 N. Y. 131 (1879). 2His continuance in office may bind the corporation by his acts, but does not prevent a creditor attacking an as- signment for creditors made by him in behalf of the bank. Cupit v. Park City Bank, 20 Utah, 292 (1899). Where a di- rector, who is also treasurer, sells his stock to the other directors, it being a part of the sale that he give up his of-
			flees, the corporation may treat Iis offices as vacant. Anderson, et. Co. v. Pungs, 127 Mich. 543 (1901) An injunc- tion suit by a director to restrain the other directors from excluding him from tile board fails where the charter provides that any director accepting an office for profit in the company thereby vacated his directorship, and he had accepted a position of trustee of a corporate mortgage. Astley v. New Tivoli, Ltd., [1899] 1 Cb. 151. Notes issued by directors who are disqualified by having sold their stock and as a scheme to create a liability on the part of the stockholders are not good. espe- cially where the meeting of the direct- ors was not properly called. Close v. Potter, 155 N. Y. 145 (1898). Directors cannot be ousted from office simply be- cause they have sold all the corporate property to themselves. The proper remedy is a suit to set aside the sale. Stanley v. Luse, 36 Oreg. 25 (1899). 3 Brown v. Clow, 62 N. E. Rep. 1000 (Ind. 1902). Where the board of direct- ors allow an illegal preference to one director they are personally liable to other creditors to the extent of such preference, and even though one of them resigns. the liability continues for the benefit of past as well as future creditors.

			*But a stockholder cannot prove by parol that a dividend was declared, the records not sllowing tho saino. Iis remedy is by prooooedings to correct the corporate record.1 A creditor cannot complain that the corporation sold solno of its property to two directors in consideration of their paying certain of the debts; noither can ho clahn that the transac. tion was not duly authorized by the board of directors or signed by the proper officers, whero lie as partiol- pltod in the results of their action.

Manchester St, Ry. v. Williams, 52 Atl. Rep. 401 (N. H. 1002). Even though no formal resolutions are passed or record made, yet, if all the stock- holders and directors are present, and it is agreed that one stockholder should loan money to the company, the com- pany must repay the same. Burke v. Sidra Bay Co., 99 N. W. Rep. 568 (Wis. 190). A mortgage authlorized at a stockholders&#x0027; meeting at which all the directors were present is legally au- thorized. Crossette v.

Rep. 118 (1801). "Where a corporation consists of a small number of persons, like a part. nership, they may transact all their business by conversation, withlo.t formal votes; and it would be a viola. tion otthe plainest principles of justice to hold those who deal with them to prove all their acts by written votes, which they do not keep or do not pro. duce." Melledge v. Boston; etc. Co., 59 Mass. 158, 170 (849). Parol evidence may be given to prove a vote of a sal- ary to an officerl where the secretary is dead and the minute-book does not contain a record of the vote. Pickett v. Abney, 84 Tex. 045 (1802). A vote of the directors employing a person is not a contract. It must be known to and accepted by the person employed. It may be shown by parol that the con. tract was to be binding only in case certain negotiations were carried out. A statement by the treasurer. showing the liabilities and making no mention of his salary, is admissible as evidence. Sears v. King&#x0027;s, etc. R. R., 152 IMass. 151 (180).

			i§ 7lo. there are a few decisions in some other states following tho Illi. nois rule.
			The board of directors may of course expressly authorize tbo presidnit to contract; or his authority to contract may arise from his having assumed and excrcised that power in the past; or the corporation may ratify his contract or : copt the benefits of it and thereby ba bound. But the general rule in that the president can- not act or contract for the corporation any moro than any other director. This question has frequently been before the courts, and many decisions have been rendered in regard to it. A large num- ber of the cases are given in the notes bolow.2 ias no inherent power to make an as- signment for the benefit of creditors, even though the president is dead, and even though the vice-president owns zmot of the rtock. Friedman t. Lesher, 61 N. E. Rep. 7361( (11. 1900). I Where the president is apparently in charge of the business, he may bind tie corporation by a contract made by him in its behalf. Mleating t.

A uni- form practice of a company for several months previous to the transfer of a corporate note by its president, in cases of notes negotiated for tile purpose of raising money to carry on its legiti- mate business, where such notes were payable.to the company, to have them indorsed by the president, is sufficient authority for his indorsement.

			may." Tho corporate senl must ho used in deeds and other instru. iments which would require a seal if they wore theo oeeds or instru- ments of individualns. A corporate deed twenty-live years old, reciting that it is unler seal, is presumed to lavo boon under seal, though nono is present. &#x0027; A corporate deed, signed "J., President," is not sullciontly signed. A corporato seal is also necessary.4 A imortgalgo may bo valid although the corporate seal is not attachlcd thereto.c
			Hence the law is that a corporation may become bound by a con- tract which is executed in any of the following ways: by a written instrument sealed with tho corporate seal, and either with or with- out the corporate name signed thereto;" by an unsealed written instrument signed with the corporate nmne; by a written record of a resolution of its directors;7 by an unwritten resolution of its directors; by the oral agreements of its authorized agents; or by a valid parol contract. See also Paul- lug v. London, etc. Ity., 8 Exch. 808 (1853). Cf. Cramllpton v. Varna Ry., L. II. 7 Ch. 502 (1872). After a contract for necessary work or goods is executed by the other party, and accepted by the corporation, it must pay for the samne notwithstanding the irregularity. Clark v.

Union Gold MIin. Co. tv Bank, 2 Colo. 220 (1873).

Where the seal of a company has been duly affixed to a mortgage by the secre- tary, the mortgagee need not inquire whether the secretary was duly author- ized to affix it, or whether a quorum of the directors was present at the meet- ing and authorized the mortgage, the court upholding the mortgage,although a quorum was not present when it was authorized.

Where the namo of tlhe corporation as grantor in a deedl is signed by a person as treasurer and the seal is attached, it is presumed that the corporation authorized the execu. tion of the deed. Carr v. Georgia, etc. Co., 108 a,. 757 (1809. On an appeal the corporate seal will be presumed to havo been on a deed of the corporation, and hence that the deed was duly exe- cuted, Almand v.

Where thero is no statute or by-law requiring a private corporation to keep a minute-book, it seems that the certificate of the secre- tary under the corporate seal that a resolution was passed cannot be ques- tioned by any one claiming under or through the corporation. Prentiss. etc. Co. v. Godchaux, 00 Fed. Rep. 2:4 (1894). Where it is proven that tile proper agents of a corporation signed a deed, and the seal attached to the deed is presumed to be the corporate seal. such presumption is not overcome by proof that no vote of the directors was had authorizing the execution of the deed. Ruffner v. Welton, etc. Co., 36 W. Va. 244 (1892). Although the proper signa- tures and seal attached to corporate contracts, deeds, and mortgages raises a presumption of authority on the part of the officers to sign, yet the want of authority may be shown. Leggett v. New Jersey, etc. Co., 1 N. J. Eq. 541 (1832).

Where ai contract is signed by the second vice-president and assistant secretary, and ias the seal attached, it is presumed to have been properly exe. cuted. Gutzeil v. Pennic, 95 Cal. 5)8 (1892). Where a corporate deed is not under seal, proof must be given that the corporation authorized the deed. Barney v. Pforr, 117 Cal. 56 (1897). In IMaine it has been held that tie pres- ence of the corlporate seal on an in- strument does not raise a presumption that the corporation entered into the contract. Morrison v. Wilder Gas Co., 91 Me. 492 (1898). The court evidently overlooked the fact that originally a corporation signed a deed or contract by afixing its seal without any written signature whatsoever, and that conse- quently. upon proof that such seal was the corporate seal, the presumption arose that it was properly affixed, just as proof of the signature of the maker of a promissory note raises a presump- tion that the maker signed the note and was bound by it. 1 An acknowledgment is "the act of one who has executed a deed in going before some competent officer or court and declaring it to be his act or deed."
			IIllnce, ven tlougll tlhe notary&#x0027;s cor- tillcato may be inHsullicint it muay bo shown that the corporate olllicer, author- ized to executu the deed, did actually an- knowledgo such execution, tile statute not requiring the certificate of acknowl. edgmont to appear upon tihe document. Lindermnan v. Iastings, etc. Co., 38 N. &#x0027;. App. Div. 488 (1890). A defective acknowledgmlent does not alfect a deed as between the parties. Marvin v. An- derson, 111 Wis. 387 (1001!. 2 The oilcer or agent wilo, in behalf of tle corporation, affixes tile common seal to an instrument is, in the absence of any statutory provision, deemed tlh agent executing it. He also stands in tile relation of a subscribing witness to the execution of the deed by ile corpo- ration, and is tle proper party to be examined or to make affidavit to prove that tle seal affixed by hlim was the corporate seal, and that it was affixed by authority of the board of directors. Bowers v. Heclhtman, 45 Minn. 238 (1891). Tle deed of a corporation is ca- pableof being acknowledged. Proving the execution is not the only way of preparing it for record. Hopper tv Lovejoy, 47 N. J. Eq. 573 (1891). Au- thority to execute gives authority to acknowledge the instrument. Wright v. Lee, 2 S. D. 596 (1892). The deed is good though there is no attestation as to seal. Smith v.

Even though the acknowledg- ment by an Arkansas corporation of a mortgage on land in Arkansas is in the usual common-law form, but not in ac- cordance with the statute of Arkansas, yet any defect may be cured by stat- nte. Steersv. Kinsey, 68 Ark. 300(1000). In West Virginia a certificate of ac- knowledgment of a deed by a corpora- tion which fails to show that the officer executing it was sworn and deposed to the facts required by statute is in- sufficient, and a record of the deed is not notice. Abney v. Ohio, etc. Co., 45 W. Va. 440 (1898). A deed may conclude with the words: "In testimony whereof the common seal of said company is hereunto affixed." Bason v. King&#x0027;s Mountain Min. Co., 90 N. C. 417 (1884). As already stated, if the seal is attached, this raises the presumption that the

But the courts have quite uniformly defeated such attempts to hold the olticer or agent liable. If the instrument or contract indicates that the officer or agent is acting only as agent, and if the name of the corporation appears on the instrument, the officer or agent is not liable thereon.4

Siplt." Franillland v. Jolihson, 147 II1. 520 (180:). A treasurer is not liable on a noto sigmnd as follows: "The Sanitary Milk-Sti)uply Co.. T. A. -Hustol, Trs." Gllealon v. Sanitary, etc. Co.. 1)3 Ale. 544 (1900). A note reading "We promiso to pay," and sigIle by tile corporation and also by tile oll. cers as oilleers, does not render tile lat- ter liable personally. Wilson v. Fito, 10 S. W. Rep. 105O (Tenn. 1807). Tile following indorsenent on negotiable paper, "Estate of Wheeler, Wing, Ex. ecutor," does not bind suell executor individually, even though it does not bind tle estate. Grafton Nat. Bank v. Wing, 172 Mass. 513 (1899). A note signed by an individual maker, with the word "President" following the signature, is at law a personal note, and the word "President," etc., is disre- garded. The defendant, however. may by cross-complaini cause tile note to be reformed on the ground of a mistake, and thus relieve himself from liability and render the corporation liable. Prescott v. Hixon, 22 Ind. App. 139 (1899). Where the body of a note does not refer to the company, and it is signed by individuals with tile words "President," etc., following their names, they are liable personally on the note, but the defendants may file a cross-bill to have the note reformed so as to relieve them from personal liability. Lawrence County Bank v. Arndt, 60 Ark. 406 (1901). A guaranty signed by an individual in his own name, followed by the letters "Pt.," may be shown to be the obligation of

Gilnore, 45 N. Y. App. Div. 89 (189)). Where the nammeof an individual is the samo as that of a corporation of which lie is president, parol evidence Illy show that tile signature to an illn- strunlent was the signature of tile company and not of tile Individual. lall v. Ochs, 34 N. Y. App. Div. 103 (1898). A note signed with the com- pany&#x0027;s name per oflicers does not bind them personally, nithough the body of the note reads "We promise to pay." Williams v. Harris, 198 III. 501 (1902). Where the unissued stock of a corpora- tion (upon its reorganization on the ex- piration of its charter) is issued to tile president as trustee to sell from time to time. and to turn over the proceeds of tile sales to the company, tile fact tllat lie gives the company a note for the same signed by hilm as "Trustee for Bank" does not render him liable on such note upon the bank becoming in- solvent, Neptune v. Paxton, 15 Ind. App. 284 (1800). Where the directors sign a corporate note on the back with the words added "board of directors," it may be shown by parol evidence that they signed it as directors, and are not liable personally. Kline v. Bank of Tescott, 50 Kan. 91 (1892). A note signed "G. A. Colby, President Pac. Peat Coal Co., D. K. Tripp, Sec. pro tern.," is on its face a corporate note. Farmers&#x0027;, etc. Bank v.

			Tle suproino court of the United States lays down tho rulo as follows: " Ono who takes from a railroad or business corporation inl good faith, and without actual notice of any inherent dtefect, a negotiable obligation issued by order of the board of directors, signed by the president and secretary in tlh name and under tlh seal of the corporation, and disclosing upon its face no want of au- thority, lhas tile right to assume its validity, if tile corporation could, by any action of its ollicers or stockholders, or of both, have author- ized the execution and issue of the obligation."3
			These rules, however, do not apply to usurpations of authority by Land Credit Co., L. R. 4 Ch. 400 (1809), where bills of exchange had been is- sued and the directors knew it and ac- qluicsced. Whore the statute requires the consent of the court to a mortgage, thlo mortgage cannot be foreclosed if such consent was not obtained. Dudley c. Congregation of St. Francis, N.Y. L. J., Sept. 2, 1801; s. c., 138 N. Y. 451 (1893).
			Asllley Wire Co. tv Illinois Steel Co., 104 111. 149 (1890). Where a mortgage is approved by all the stock except two slhares, it is good as an equitable mort- gage, even though the meeting of stock- holders authorizing it was not called by advertisement as required by stat- ute. Central Trust Co. v. Bridges, 57 Fed. Rep. 753 (1893). Even though the statutory notice of a stockholder&#x0027;s meet- ing is not given, a niortgage authorized by the board of directors elected at such a meeting is legal, where the cor- poration receives the benefit therefrom, without anystockholder objecting. At- lantic, etc. Co. t. The Vigilancia, 73 Fed. Rep. 452 (1890). Althougll te stat- ute requires three directors, who shall be stockholders, and one assigns his stock, and the other two authorize and execute a corporate mortgage at a meet- ing held without notice to the other, yet the mortgagee, having no knowl-
			edge of these facts, is protected. Kusor v. Wright, 52 N. J. Eq. 825 (1895), rev&#x0027;g Wright v. First Nat. Bank, 52 N. J. Eq. 392 (18901). 2 County, etc. Bank v. Rudry Alorthyr, etc. Co., [1895] 1 Ch. 029. A mortgagee is chargeable with knowledge of the fact that the statute required three di- rectors, and that the company only had two directors when the mortgage was authorized. Wriglt tv First Nat. Bank, 52 N. J. Eq. 302 (1894). It is no defense to a mortgage that the directors au- thorizing It were irregularly elected, the stockholders having acquiesced. Savage v. Miller, 86 Atl. Rep. 578 (N. J. 1897). A mortgagee need not inquire whether a resolution of the directors authorizing a mortgage, and recited therein, has been actually passed by them. Manhattan Hardware Co. v. Roland, 128 Pa. St. 119 (1889). Where a mortgage on its face has been reg- ularly executed it is not necessary in a foreclosure suit to prove a resolu- tion of the board of directors authoriz- ing it. proof of delivery and the pay- ment of consideration to. the corpora- tion having been given.

			corporato officers. As already explained, tile authority of the presi- dent, secretary and treasurer and other officers tu mnako contracts for the corporation is exceedingly limited.&#x0027; They must have special authority froil the board of directors. llonce the mero fact that they have signed tile corporato name to a contraot and affixed the corl)orato seal does not niake tile instrument binding on the cor- poration. It raisos a presumlption,2 but this presumption may be overthrown. Consequently it is dificult to lay down dellnito rules as to wlhn a corporation is and when it is not Iound by a contract which apparently has been regularly executed by the corporation through its proper officers. The tendency is to lold the corporation liable, inasmuch as it selects its own ollicers and should be to a cer- tain extent responsible for their acts in signing the corporate name and attaching tile corporate seal to contracts. Where the charter provides tlat certain contracts may be made only after an act has been peforfo ed by tie company, a third person may rely on the coim- pany&#x0027;s representation that the act has been done.3 L by-law rcquir- Co., 174 U. S. 552, 573 (1600), the court saying also that the records of the cor. poration and its board of directors are private records which a person dealing with the corporation is not bound to inspect is lie would be bound in case of a public record. A bona fide purchaser of corporate bonds is entitled "to presume that all necessary preliminaries not required to be a matter of public record have been properly performed," and hence is it no defense that the directors met out of the state when they authorized the mortgage securing the issue. Schultze :vVan Doren, 53 Atl. Rep. 8i5(N. J. 1902). Where the board of directors have power to borrow money and issue deben- tures, and a debenture is issued in due form on its face, a bunu Jide holder thereof is protected, although the com- pany had not been fully organized and no directors had been appointed and no resolutions passed by theru. Duck v. Tower, etc. Co., [1001] 2 K. B. 314. Where a person loans money to a corporation and pays it over to the secretary and takes the note of the company executed by the president and secretary, the note is good, even though they took .the
			18
			money and used it to pay for stock in another corporation. Allen v. West Point, etc. Co., 81 S. Rep. 406 (Ala. 19021. Where the secretary and treasurer and a director have been allowed to transact the business of the company and they borrow money for the company and give the company&#x0027;s bond and mortgage therefor, and produce a certified copy of a resolution passed by the board of directors, the lender may rely on such certified copy, even though it after- wards turns out to have been unau- thorized.

Tho frucleuintly olted ilase of Iartford llank v.

KanuTiman, 4 Serg. &#x0026; R. (Pa.) 317 (1818), holding that while acts and declarntions of trustees and agents of the congregation, in their offcial ca- pacities, are evidence against those wholi they represent, yet their state- imets made not in the transaction of the business of their principal are not evidence. " A fact once admitted by a corporation through its officer, duly and properly acting within the scope of his authority, is evidence against it, and cannot be withdrawn to the prejudice of any one who, in reliance upon it, has changed his situation in respect to the natteraffected thereby. Insuchacase the doctrine of estoppel applies to a cor- poration as well as to an individual." O&#x0027;Leary tr Board of Education, 93 N. Y. 1 (1883). Admissions of a director who is also a member of the discount board of a bank do not bind the corporation unless he was a duly authorized agent. East River Bank v. Hoyt, 41 Barb 1l41 (1804).

			how far the corporation is bound by the declarations of subordi- nate agents frequently arises in the courts. Tile general rule is very much the saino as prevails in regard to admissions made by agents of a large business copartnorship. If the admission per- tained to matters within the scope of that particular agent&#x0027;s pow- ers, or apparent powers, the principal is bound, otherwiso it is not. Thus an inquiry, by a purchaser of stock, of corporate ollicers, as to whether it was full-paid stock, must be made of officers having authority to speak for the corporation.&#x0027;

Co. v. Boll, 22 Barb. 04, 01 (1850) Knowledge of a di- rector, acquired by reading a notice thereof in a newspaper, that a firm has dissolved and that certain partners are no longer liable, is not notice to tho corporation; ho did not acquire the knowledge nor was it given to him for the cdrporation. National Bank v. Nor- ton, 1 Hill, 572 (1841). On a question as to the ratification by a company of the unauthorized act of its president, where it is necessary to show knowledge on the part of the company, it is not enough to show an individual knowledge on the part of the minority of the board of trustees, even if a knowledge by all of them in their individual capacity, and not acting as a board, would be suffi- cient. Yellow Jacket, etc. Co. v. Steven- son, 5 Nov. 224 (1800). A corporation is not chargeable with any knowledge of a deed which a director discovers on examining the record unofficially. Far- rell Foundry v. Dart. 20 Conn. 876 (1857). Notice to a director, not constituted an organ of communication between the parties, that a promissory note was made to be discounted fora special pur- pose, is not notice to the bank, although the director was present when the note was discounted.

			A liroctor cannot claim to be boalaf le purchaser of bonds upon their issue by the corporation. IIe is bound to know what trans- pires in tile meetings of the board of directors.&#x0027; Where a conl- pany soils land to its president and secretary, they are charged with knowledge of facts known to tho company, the lhtter having boon present at tie mootings.2 The question sometimes arises whether a director or olilcer of n corporation is chargeablo with notice of tll facts contained in the corporate books. The general rule is that lel is not chargeable with actual knowledge of such en- tries,3 but such entries are admissible in evidence against him in Louis, 138 U. S. 1 (1891).

Hence, in an action by the corporation for an accounting, the books of the company are not competent evidence to establish the account and hold him liable. Rudd v. Robinson, 126 N.Y. 113 (1891). General entries upon the ledger of the corporation do not charge a di- rector with notice thereof, unless it is proved that he had access to the ledger or control over it. Leonard v. Faber, 52 N. Y. App. Div. 495 (1900), the court stating that corporate books, such as the stock-book and minute-books con- taining records in which third parties are not interested, are evidence of the facts set forth in them both in favor and against the corporation, but that account. books showing transactions be- tween the corporation and third per- sons are similar to account books of
			other parties and are admissiblo only as admissions by the corporation. In a suit by a receiver of a national bank to recover back dividends ille. gally paid, the books of the bank are competent evidence to prove the&#x0027;acts of the corporation and its financial condition, except as to dealings beo tween the corporation and the defend- ant.

Converse v. Sharpe, 101 N. Y. 571 (1000). A discussion of what constitutes insolvency of a cor- poration, and stating that the directors are bound to know the condition of business, is given in Consolidated Tank Line Co. v.

The rule that a bank is estopped by the state- ment of its cashier to a surety that his principal had paid the note is not applicable where the surety is a di- rector of the bank, for he will be con- clusively presumed to know whether payment was made. His knowledge will also be imputed to a firm which was the security and of which he was a member. Merchants&#x0027; Bank v. Rudolf, 5 Neb. 528 (1877. See also § 714, supra.

			the doctrine of laches herein. § 728. Introductory.- When a stockholder brings an action to remedy the frauds, ultra vires acts, or negligence of a director or third person, the most common and dangerous defense that he has to encounter is the defense that he has been guilty of laches in bringing his action. Like the defense of contributory negligence- a modern principle of law that defeats many actions for negli- gence-so the defense of laches, acquiescence, or ratification has sprung up to defeat stockholders&#x0027; actions herein. The principles which govern, define, and explain this defense have become well settled. They form the subject of this chapter.
			§ 729. Laches, acquiescence, or ratification as a defense to a stoc7kholder&#x0027;s action to ,remedy illegal corporate acts which are lpro- hibited by statute or contrary topublic policy.-It has already been shown that a stockholder may bring an action to remedy frauds, negligence, or ultra vires acts. As regards the frauds and negli- gence of corporate officers, it is well settled that laches is a good defense to a stockholder&#x0027;s action herein. In reference to ultra vires acts, however, which are mala prohibita or mala in se, there is more difficulty. It is very $lear that no assent or acquiescence of the stockholders can vaiitatirtrch acts.1 l See Kent v. Quicksilver Min. Co., 78 N.Y. 150,186 (1879), where the court said: "A corporation may do acts which affect the public to its harm, inasmuch as they are per se illegal or are malum prohibitum. Then no assent of stock- holders can validate them." A con- tract in which the directors are inter-
			ested, where it is void by statute, can- not be enforced on the ground of waiver by the corporation. Barton v. Port Jackson, etc. Co., 17 Barb. 397 (1854). "Void " cannot be construed as "void- able" in a statute which is enacted from public policy, and not for the benefit of parties only. Rex v. Hips- 1846

		<ocrText>
			But it is a different question to determine whetler, after long acquiescence, the stockholder may take advantage of the invalidity of such acts. mal ro/hlibl&#x0027;a - tlat is, acts expressly prollbited by statute - th stockhollor may be barred by Inches from complaining thereof, since tile state, through its attorney- general, may protect the interests of the publio.&#x0027; The stockholder, however, may sue on the ground that unless the evil is corrected the state may forfeit the corporate franchises.&#x0027; As regards acts mala in sc, probably the rule will depend on the circumstances of the case. I&#x0027; the stockholder has participated in the act or knowingly accepted the benefit thereof, the court will not aid him, since lh who comes into equity must do so with clean hands.3 Thus, where it lease of a railroad is ultra vires, a bill in equity filed by one of the parties to the contract will not lie to set it aside. The court will aid neither party, they being in pari delitlo. When, however, a stockholder has not participated or knowingly accepted the benefit of corporate contracts which are mala in so, there would seem to be no reason wliy mere delay on his part in bringing suit to set aside such acts should bo fatal to his bill. As to the corpo- ration itself, the fact of its participating in an act which is merely beyond the powers of a corporation, but is not prohibited by stat- ute or pernicious in itself, may not be a bar to recovery upon the contract.&#x0027; A suit in equity lies at the instance of a railroad corpo- ration that has guaranteed negotiable bonds of another railroad corporation to have such guaranty canceled and suits upon the well, 8 B. &#x0026; C. 460 (1828), concerning a statute against binding out children. For a collection of the cases on ultra vires acts as mala prohibita and mala in se, see an article in The Counsellor, vol. 4, p. 151. 1 See Stewart vt Erie, etc. Transp. Co., 17 Minn. 372 (1871): and Gray v. Chap- lin, 2 Russ. CIL 127 (1826), where the court held that the stockholder cannot claim that the public is wronged. If a public right is to be enforced. it must be at the suit of those to whom the protection of public rights belongs. Cf. Ashbury, etc. Co. v. Riche, L. R. 7 H. L 053 (1875); s. c., L. R 9 Exch. 224, 262. That which is forbidden by statute cannot be ratified. Nellis Co. v. Nellis, 62 Hun, 63 (18&#x0027;1); Taylor v. Chichester, etc. Ry.. L. . 2 Exch. 355 (1867).

			2 Mlanderson v. Commercial Bank, 28 Pa. St. 379 (1857), where discounts were being improperly made. 3 See§ 89, supra. A stockholder in a corporation cannot sustain a bill to have the charter forfeited and the cor- poration wound up on the ground that it was formed to purchase and combine various competing linseed-oil mills for the purpose of forming a monopoly. The state alone can ask for such a for- feiture. Moreover. the stockholder by being a stockholder is estopped from complaining, and is presumed to have had knowledge of the facts from the time when he became a stockholder. Coquard v. National L S. Co., 171 III. 480 (1898). Cf. 93 N. W. Rep. 997. 4 St. Louis, etc. R . . v. Terre -Iaute, etc. R. R., 145 U. S. 393 (1892).

			731(&#x003E;E. JErljress ratification herein - Tl&#x0027;in.sfereo of stock that 7tas been coted in fit or of&#x0027; the actl cannot complaini.- Tloro are in gen- eral two ways in which a stockholder may bo said to have ratified an act of tile directors which lie is attempting to enjoin or set aside. The ratification may be by an express agreement or state- mint to that effect, or it may be by such laches or acquiescence as will amount to an implied ratification.3 Cases involving the de- sense of an express ratification rarely arise, since this defense is easy to prove.&#x0027; But a provision in a contract of subscription to the stock of the col)pany whereby the subscriber waives notice of all contracts between tie promoters and the company is not bind- ing on tile stockholder if suclh waiver is tricky and fraudulent.5 If I Louisville, etc. Ry. r.

			[§ 782. depends on the oiroumstanc:s of the case. Tho length of time during which a stockholder may delay in bringing his suit varies with each case, according to the circumstances of that case. The court requires that reasonable promptness be exercised so that largo investments of now money or changes in the ownership of the stock or property may not be prevented or jeopardized by an un- reasonable delay on the part of a stockholder in objecting to the transaction.

A suit by a promoter to compel the delivery of stock to him on the ground that &#x0027;,.li- out his consent and knowledge ul .n- corporation made in accordance with his contract had been abandoned and a new one adopted from which lie had been excluded is a suit for breach of trust and not for fraud, and hence the statute of limitations applicable to the latter is not a bar. Farris v. Wirt, 6J Pac. Rep. 946 (Colo. 1901). . stock- holders&#x0027; suit to hold a director liable for purchasing property of the corpora- tion is a suit for breach of trust and not for a fraud separate from such breach, and hence a statute of limita- tions applicable to the former is the one applicable to such a case.

Where a majority of the directors of an irrigation company are mem;bers o? an association wlhinh de- sires to obtain water from such corpo- ration, a contract to that effect which is sololy for the benefit of the associa- tion is illegal and may be repudiated by the corporation, even though such contract was openly made, and even though the directors were guilty of laches in not causing the contract to be set aside, and in the meantime the association has spent its money in in- stalling its plant. Goodell v. Verdugo, etc. Co., 71 Pac. Rep. 354 (Cal. 1903), the court saying, " the publicity alone of an illegal and unauthorized act of the directors of the corporation does not make it legal or valid." Even though the directors are to re- ceive a commission on bonds which they sell for the corporation, yet if the stockholders are notified of the same and ratify the transaction in meeting assembled, the minority stockholders cannot complain, the transaction itself being a fair one. The directors may vote their own stock at ouch meeting and the ratification is legal,even though their stock was necessary in order to carry t&#x0027;: resolutions. The court said: "Like other stockholders, they had a right to be influenced by what they conceived to be for their own interest, and they cannot lawfully be denied
			that right, nor can it be limited or oir- cumscribed by the fact that they occu- pied the position of directors in the company." IIodgov. United StatesStool Corp., 54 Atl. Rep. 1 (N. J. 1903). The court further said: " In Leavenworth v. Chicago Ry. Co., 184 U.
